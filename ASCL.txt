Dear HOPS Folks,
I came across your code HOPS while looking for astrophysics codes and have listed this code in the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL). The ASCL ID for the code is ascl:2205.019, and the entry’s permalink is https://ascl.net/2205.019. The ASCL is indexed by ADS and Web of Science, and its entries have been cited in over 100 journals. If any of the information in the listing is incorrect, please let me know; thank you.
The ASCL recommends that code authors assign a license to their software and make it clear how use of the code should be cited, preferably by use of a CITATION.md, CITATION.cff, or codemeta.json file added to the root of your code repo. Editable examples of the latter two can be generated by adding /CITATION.cff or /codemeta.json to the link provided above for your code’s entry. Should you choose to use the ASCL entry for citation, a suggested format is available online.
The ASCL seeks to increase the integrity of astrophysics research by making research software discoverable for examination and I am always looking for codes which have been used in refereed research. If you have additional codes that have been used for research, I would like very much to include them in the ASCL.

Thank you very much!
