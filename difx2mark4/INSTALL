To install from a fresh svn checkout, run the following:

aclocal
autoconf
autoheader
automake -a

./configure --prefix=${DIFXROOT}
make
make install

After this, changes to sources require make/make install to be run, and
after changes to the configuration, autoreconf suffices.

All of the above is handled from the main hops configure script if you
invoke

    .../trunk/configure --enable-d2m4 ... DIFXROOT=$DIFXROOT

but note the application will be installed in the $HOPS_ROOT area.
