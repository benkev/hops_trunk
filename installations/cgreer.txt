   Hi Geoff,
   Here are the rough steps I used to get HOPS working on my laptop. Let me
   know if you need any more information.

   System info:
   MacBook Pro Retina (Mid 2012)
   2.6 GHz Intel Core i7
   OS X 10.8.2
   $ gcc --version
   i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-gcc-4.2 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build
   5658) (LLVM build 2336.11.00)
   0. Already had ghostscript and pgplot installed via MacPorts. GS version:
   9.06 and pgplot 5.2.2.
   1. Downloaded the hops-3.8 build 756 tarball
   from\240[1]ftp://gemini.haystack.mit.edu/pub/hops.
   2. Modified the file hops-3.8/configure to replace every mention of
   libpng12 to libpng.
   3. Linked gs into /usr/bin as described in hops-3.8/MacPorts.txt
   4. Linked pgplot into /opt/local/pgplot as described in
   hops-3.8/MacPorts.txt
   5. Ran configure as: ../hops-3.8/configure LDFLAGS=-L/opt/X11/lib
   X_INSANE='-lobjc -framework Foundation -L/opt/local/lib -lpng
   -F/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/ -framework AquaTerm'
   NB: AquaTerm was installed via MacPorts as well, and didn't provide the
   libaquaterm library anymore. Apparently Frameworks is a different way of
   doing this?
   6. make; sudo make install; make check\240
