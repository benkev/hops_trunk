Fearfit is a developmental version of fourfit which allows testing
of new features and/or activation of special purpose features.
All of its capabilities are activated by environment variables,
and do not affect fearfit's ability to perform the same way that
fourfit does.  All the code is (at present) in files hook_*.c
which includes the corresponding C source code file.

This is intended to be an experimental tool to allow the development
of new features with some certainty of not breaking the existing tool.
This functionality has only been tested to the extent that fourfit
itself is not adversely affected.  And some of it is broken due to
changes in fourfit that have not (yet) been re-implemented.

hook_make_plotdata.c:
    HOPS_FEARFIT_XPSPEC=<int>	dump the cross-power spectrum if nonzero
    HOPS_FEARFIT_SDELAY=<int>	dump the single-band delay data if nonzero

hook_norm.c:
    Rotates the spectrum by
	theta = 2*M_PI * factor * ( freq + ii * sign - freqlo ) * ap

    HOPS_FEARFIT_BEFORE=<int>	dump the spectrum before rotation if nonzero
    HOPS_FEARFIT_AFTER=<int>	dump the spectrum after rotation if nonzero
    HOPS_FEARFIT_FACTOR=<float>	specifies the rotation factor
    HOPS_FEARFIT_FREQLO=<float>
    HOPS_FEARFIT_FREQLO="ref_freq"
				specifies the LO freq offset

hook_output.c:
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_VERB
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_NOMAST
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_SWAP
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_MEDFR
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_POLICY
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_NCHAN
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_DERATE
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_DELTA  variables related to setting manual pc phases
             
hook_search.c:
hook_freq_spacing.c:
    HOPS_FEARFIT_MBDGRID        trying harder on MBD grid

To add new features, create a file hook_<fourfit_file.c> which should
include the original fourfit source (with appropriate edits); add it to
the repository.

Use appropriate HOPS_FEARFIT_something environment variables, and
document them appropriately in trunk/help/fearfit.doc.

Update the hook_import.sh (see # FEARFIT#X comments) test to
 1. note the line count of the files you change
 2. verify that the source hasn't been changed, and to
 3. insert the appropriate hooks into the imported source.  Follow the
    samples and use #ifdef something_HOOK to mark your your insertion.
    Depending on what you are doing, you may just want to replace the
    routine rather than using HOOKs into the original.
 4. update the build dependencies for the makefile in fearfit.mk
 5. update the help/fearfit.doc for the user.

The automake machinery should then (in principal) build fearfit if you
have made all the required changes to hook_import.sh.
