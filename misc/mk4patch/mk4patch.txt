   Hi Geoff,

   Attached.

   "swpchid.c" is very specific so I don't think it will be that useful.

   "genroot.c" and "synroot.c" can generate root code according to epoch time
   and sync the in-file root codes with the file name, respectively.

   "synroot.c" doesn't require any HOPS header because I hardwire the record
   size---so it may not be that portable.
