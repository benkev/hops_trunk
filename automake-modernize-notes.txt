# NOEMA:
    step 1 introduces frqs as alias for freqs and some associated games.
    step 2 verifies alias channels actually work
    step 3 proceed to surgery commands

# any round -- in progress.
x   Should restore max_parity to emit an error message while ignoring it.
    -f / -n options should also be CF keyword controlled and also
        fall under the control of the new alias system. Or even:
        display_channels <channel-list>

# any round: elevate the polarization defines to a common location

# any round: what about stale locks in priorty locking mechanism.
    if ^C is hit between creation and deletion, it won't go away
    signal handlers call _exit() which doesn't invoke atexit().
    possibly install a signal handler, and then remove it....

# any round; fix the return value from fourfit so that existing tests
    are happy.

# any round: generate_graphs is a total mess, should be sub-functioned.

# any round: use ompi parallelization directives to speed up some loops.
  or can also try loop multiprocessor optimisations....
  CF: TELCAL examples -- but this only works if underlying code is
  fully re-entrant

# any round:
  cabs has a sqrt, but r^2+i^2 does not and sqrt is not needed.

other various other random unsorted/not-yet-editted notes..

HOPS3/4:
    Need to make psplot and fplot allow polarization selection
      and/or differentiation of "close" points
    pull HOPS3.2x tarballs into MRD
    migrate HOPS3 tests to use tarballs
    review MRD tarballs
    should have a script to do a more automated cofit
HOPS4
    plantuml , SWIG4.x to captive 'data' area.
    nightly (whither pgplot.h)
        PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
        /usr/local/pgplot/cpgplot.h
        the fourfit build in HOPS4 needs cleanup to take pkg-config into account
        hops-git: should pick up HOPS3->git with data plan
regression data for new HOPS e.g. gefera:
        $ l /swc/difx/difx-data/regression/bm494e-wxpsc-????.tgz
        -rw-rw----. 1 gbc difx 13227021 Oct 31 09:30
            /swc/difx/difx-data/regression/bm494e-wxpsc-difx.tgz
        -rw-rw----. 1 gbc difx 14661016 Oct 31 09:37
            /swc/difx/difx-data/regression/bm494e-wxpsc-hops.tgz
    needs a revist due to repaired passband SNR....

----

Jan-05-HOPS-TTD:
 1  finish the MRD data tarball area--it was mostly complete once
        upon a time, but needs review
 2  autobarf needs an update at some point
 3  coping mechanism for NOEMA data
 4  regression test updates, including on polconvert
    we should make a push to actually capture some
    geodetic scans so that meaningful regression can be done.
