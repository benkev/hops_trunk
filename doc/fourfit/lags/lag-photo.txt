Correct. Due to the 2X 0-padding prior to the first fft the sample spacing
is actually 1/2 the real sample spacing. Thus nlags is at the middle of
the lag space.

Now, Nyquist tells us an offset of 1 sample corresponds to 180 degrees of
phase at the upper band edge. Thus the interpolated 1/2 sample equates to
90 degrees at the upper band edge. or a mean offset of 45 degrees, which
is 1/8 of a rotation.

(param.nlags - status.max_delchan) is just the residual delay of the
best-fit lag in semi-samples.

Doubling the lags for FX mode was just to put the FX processing into a
consistent framework with the old XF processing. I'll email separately a
whiteboard photo I took back when investigating this issue, then at some
point we could discuss that.

As promised and/or threatened, depending on your viewpoint, here was the
drawing on whiteboard. I see looking at it now that the green color was
faint. There is a conjugate & copy of the LSB upward after the 2n fft.
Also, after the 4n fft there is a copy downward into the lower half of lag
space.
