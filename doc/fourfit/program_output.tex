At the end of each fringe fit data are written to type 2
files within the current fileset, unless the program is
run in test mode with -t. These files contain all of the
information relevant to the fringe fit, and become the
input for subsequent astronomic or geodetic processing.
Optionally, a fringe plot may be popped up in a window,
or perhaps printed, in order to facilitate data quality
analysis.
