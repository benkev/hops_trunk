Hi Lindy,

I am not sure itâ€™s worth a modification to the paper, but just a small
+clarification on the history in section 2.  When we (Roger Chris and me)
+rewrote the FRNGE algorithms in C, we not only worked on the I/O, control and
+file structures directly associated with the correlator software and the fringe
+fitter, but we also added various kinds of functionality.  Chris pretty much
+focused on the decoding of the FRNGE fortran code, but Roger and I did most of
+the rest.  This included more complete and graphically precise representation
+of the results of the fringe fitting process (the fringe plot), new
+functionality internal to fourfit facilitated by the more modern code base, and
+a lot of machinery based on so-called A-files to manage the output products and
+use results to feed back into the correlator control and fringe fitting
+process.  That same A-file machinery was subsequently the foundation on which
+the tools for dealing with limited coherence data were based.  The main point
+was that the translation to C was accompanied and followed by a range of new
+capabilities that arrived in a steady stream over the years, and led to a HOPS
+package that was well primed for mm-VLBI work.  Roger of course carried on with
+this sort of work long after I got diverted from code-writing by other
+responsibilities.
