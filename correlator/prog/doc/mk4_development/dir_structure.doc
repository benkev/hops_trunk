\par {\f2\fs24 This document describes the organization of the /correlator directory.  This directory contains all the bits and pieces, both software and data files, needed to make the correlator run, and to postprocess the data. It serves both the MkIII 
and MkIV correlators.  The structure differs in some details from what is currently in /correlator, on which current MkIII operations depend.  The changes can be made in a short time, but they must be coordinated with changes on the HP1000 systems.}
\par 
\par {\f2\fs24 Most directories have environment variables associated with them.  It is strongly recommended that software which needs to access one or more of these directories uses these environment variables via the system getenv() call.  This allows 
easy modification of the physical directory structure as circumstances}
\par {\f2\fs24 dictate, and more importantly facilitates test setups for debugging and specialized applications.  To ease the use of these environment variables, all the important ones can be read in at the start of the program by calling the function 
"environment()", which is in the $UTIL library.  This fills in a series of external character strings with the directory paths pointed to by the environment variables.}
\par 
\par {\f2\fs24 Default definitions of the environment variables will be made available in a shell script which can be executed as desired by users.}
