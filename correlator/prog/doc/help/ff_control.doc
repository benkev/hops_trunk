FORMATS
   Time-values: 
    (NYI)Absolute times are in the format ddd:hhmmss.mmm, where the colon
         or decimal point can "anchor" surrounding numbers. If both
         are absent, then there is an implied decimal to the right of
         the last number. If both are present, there must be 6 intervening
         characters (dddhhmmss). Examples:

              field           ddd hh mm ss mmm
              -----           --- -- -- -- ---
               208:           208 00 00 00 000
               208            000 00 02 08 000
              :1432           000 14 32 00 000
          :8123456.            ** invalid **

         Relative times are depicted by a leading + or -. The rest of the
         format is the same as for absolute times.

	 As of 93.5.21 a cruder method of entering times is all that is supported.
	 Arguments of start and stop are integers with an optional minus sign. A
	 positive integer is interpreted as an absolute time in seconds past the
	 hour (of the scan start time). When a minus sign precedes the start time
	 it is considered to be a time relative to, and later than, the
	 scheduled scan start. Similarly, a negative stop time precedes the
	 scheduled scan stop time, by the indicated number of seconds.


GENERAL GUIDELINES

   1) White space is ignored; i.e., multiple spaces and line feeds all
      collapse to a single space.
   2) Multiple commands per line are fine.
   3) Comments: anything from an asterisk through the end of the line
      is ignored.
   4) Nested ifs are not allowed (or necessary). Nested parentheses in
      an if condition are fine.
   5) Wildcard "?" matches any single character for f_group, station, or
      baseline, any string (of up to 8 characters) for source, and any
      time-value for scan.
   6) Phase cal is normally treated station by station. Only freqs that are
      chosen for both stations in a baseline are present in the fit.
