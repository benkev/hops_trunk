<H1> Mark 4 Correlator Error Explanations </H1>
<A NAME="0"></A><B>0:</B> Error number 0 is not defined. You are on your
own for this one.
<P><A NAME="1"></A><B>1:</B> The building is on fire. Please shut down
the correlator in an orderly fashion before saving yourself. 

<P> <A NAME="1002"></A> <B>1002:</B> Opera was unable to open and read 
the named task-stream (.tsf) file.  Did you spell it correctly?  Is it 
really in that directory? 

<P> <A NAME="1004"></A> <B>1004:</B> Opera was unable to open and write to 
the named task-stream (.tsf) file.  Did you spell it correctly?  Is it 
really in that directory?  Do you have write permission? 

<P><A NAME="2000"></A><B>2000:</B> The correlator control manager, corrman,
has rejected a configuration request. The possible errors are encoded within
the return_code; see the Cu_Resource_Error structure in 
<A HREF="/correlator/prog/src/include/message_structs.h">message_structs.h
</A> for details. 

<P><A NAME="2001"></A><B>2001:</B> The station unit manager, suman, was
unable to be configure the indicated station unit. The return_code denotes
the cause. 

<P><A NAME="3000"></A><B>3000:</B> Suman was unable to initialize the indicated
station unit. If re-initialization doesn't correct the situation, then
the SU may need to be re-booted. 

<P><A NAME="6000"></A><B>6000:</B> Sutrx has encountered a non-recoverable
socket error for the indicated SU. Quite likely the cause is flaky SU code
that has decided to go on holidays. If this station unit is needed, it
may be necessary to exit the correlator software, reboot the SU, and start
the software up again.
