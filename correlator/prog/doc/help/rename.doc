COMMAND NAME:   rename

SYNOPSIS:  Moves files from CI names to Unix names and directories

SYNTAX:  rename [-d rootname] [-m nnn] [-o destdir] [-r] [sourcedir]
		Where the flags are optional, and sourcedir is the
		location of the CI files to be moved.

OPTION FLAGS:   -d rootname
			This switches on "dribble mode" operation
			of rename.  In this mode it operates on
			only one root file family at a time.  This
			mode is invoked automatically by the
			"dribble" script, and is the principal
			mode quasi real-time data transfer from
			the HP1000 correlator computers.  This
			mode is incompatible with the -o mode. In
			dribble mode, the sourcedir is overridden
			by the directory containing the specified
			root file.

		-m nnn
			Verbosity control.  The integer nnn can
			be anywhere from -3 to 3, higher numbers
			being less verbose.  The default is 1.

		-o destdir
			By default, rename places the files in one
			of the main correlator data areas pointed
			to by the environment variables CORDATA,
			DATA1, ..., DATAn.  This flag overrides the
			default destination, forcing the files into
			the specified destination directory.  The
			directory tree will be created there as needed,
			and no symbolic links will be created.  This
			mode is incompatible with the -d mode.

		-r
			Rename constructs a shell script to move
			the files, to avoid the complexities of
			different treatments for intra and inter
			filesystem renames.  If the -r flag is
			specified, this shell script will not be
			deleted after rename finishes, and a message
			will be printed on the terminal telling the
			user what the filename of the script is.
			This option is intended for debug purposes.

ARGUMENTS:	sourcedir
			This mandatory argument (except in dribble mode,
			see description of -d option) tells "rename" where
			to find the input data files in the CI file
			naming convention.  It is not possible to
			specify individual files to rename, except
			when using the -d option (dribble mode).  Instead,
			one should arrange for the desired subset of
			correlator files to occupy their own directory,
			and feed the name of that directory to rename.
			Specifying a directory which contains corel
			or fringe files without an associated root is
			an error.

ENVIRONMENT:	CORDATA, DATA1 ... DATAn

DESCRIPTION:

The purpose of the rename program is to convert the CI-style filenames of
correlator data files newly FTP'ed from the HP-1000 system into the standard
UNIX filename conventions.  Since the directory structure of experiment
number and scantime subdirectories is integral to the UNIX filename convention,
rename creates these directory trees as needed before renaming the actual
files.

The program has three modes.  The first two are automatic, and are intended for 
routine, unattended transfer of production correlation data to the main data
areas on the UNIX systems.  It looks at the environment variables CORDATA,
DATA1, DATA2, ... , DATAn, figures out which has the most space, and sends
all the data to that directory.  It also inserts symbolic links into $CORDATA
to create the illusion of a single monolithic data area, even though the
data are actually spread out more or less evenly across several physical
disks.

The third mode is a manual mode, intended for deliberate invocation by a user,
for the purpose of transferring specific pieces of data to a private area
on the UNIX system.  It is accessed via the -o flag, which is accompanied by
the name of the desired destination directory.  Rename will create an experiment
directory and scan subdirectories in the destination directory, and move the
data files into the resulting directory tree, ready for manipulation by other
programs.  Note that this directory tree is integral to the UNIX filenaming
convention, and much of the software will not work on data that is not properly
located in such a tree.  The subdirectory location represents additional
information to that available on the HP-1000 filesystem, which is extensively
used by the new software.

Restrictions are similarly imposed on the renaming of files without associated
roots.  The tight binding of corel and fringe files to their roots is fundamental
to the entire software system.  Programs within the system treat root, corel
and fringe files as inseparable groups, thus mimicking the HP-1000 practise of
bundling them all up into one physical file.

Except in dribble (-d) mode, which is not intended for manual use, rename 
always moves ALL files in the source directory .. there is no way to ask
it to do a desired subset of the files there.  If you need to move just a subset
of them, create a new directory and move just the subset into that directory.
Then invoke 'rename' on the new directory to achieve the desired effect.
