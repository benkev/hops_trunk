Documentation for the X_FPLOT (fringe plot popup) library

This library provides access to a mechanism for displaying fringe plots
on an X-window display.  The library uses two-dimensional character
arrays as found in type-2 fringe binary correlator files.  These files
must be read in (using the BFIO library) and the fringe-plot element of
the resulting memory-resident structure is what you feed to this
library.  For a fairly concise example of how to use this library, the
UTIL library, and the BFIO library, look in $FPLOT.  There are only four 
routines of interest to the application programmer in this library:

int				File: $X_FPLOT/open_x_fplot.c
open_x_fplot (argc, argv)		Opens the popup window on the
char **argv;				user's display, with the title
int argc;				bar displaying argv[0].  argc
					should be set to 1.  This is
					a workaround to keep low-level
					X happy.  Window is not mapped.
					Return: 0=good, else bad

int				File: $X_FPLOT/show_x_fplot.c
show_x_fplot (fplot, mode)		Maps (makes visible) window, and
char **fplot;				puts the fringe plot contained
int mode;				in "fplot" in the window.  The
					plot may be split in two halves
					depending on the screen height.
					User input is supported:
					user types     action
					  space        toggle half page
					  n            return 1
					  p            return -1
                                          q            return 0 and unmap
					 ctrl-h        call hcopy_x_fplot()

void				File: $X_fplot/hcopy_x_fplot.c
hcopy_x_fplot (fplot)			Sends the fringe plot to the
char **fplot;				shell script:
					/usr/local/bin/fplot_print
					(this should be an environment
					variable).  Can be used without
					opening the popup window.

int				File: $X_FPLOT/close_x_fplot.c
close_x_fplot ()			Shuts down the popup window.
					After this call, you must use
					open_x_fplot() again before
					show_x_fplot() will work.
