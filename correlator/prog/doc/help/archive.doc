COMMAND NAME:   archive

SYNOPSIS:  Archives a complete experiment to DAT tape

SYNTAX:  archive nnnn
		Where nnnn is the experiment number to archive

OPTION FLAGS:   None

ARGUMENTS:	Experiment number
			This mandatory argument is a number which
			tells "archive" which experiment to write
			to tape.  This script is not intended for
			use by the casual investigator, but rather
			by the person responsible for maintenance
			of the main data areas.

ENVIRONMENT:	CORDATA, DATA1 ... DATAn, DOC

DESCRIPTION:

When an experiment is complete and all useful processing of the data is
ended, the data need to be archived to tape.  This script accomplishes that
job, invoking tar on the scan directories, and logging information in
the experiment directory.  It makes an A-file of the entire experiment,
which not only goes on tape, but is also left behind in the experiment
directory, along with a log of the archive process which contains a list
of all files on tape.

Archive supports incremental additions to a pre-existing archive for a given
experiment, using the tar "u" option as necessary.  For efficiency reasons,
such incremental archives should be avoided if possible.  Because updates
write to a tape with existing data on it, errors have the potential to
destroy important information.  For that reason, the archive script urges
the user to make a backup before appending to the tape.  If this is
impractical, and you are placing a non-blank tape in the drive, take a
moment to be sure that the file "archive.log" exists in the experiment
directory.  If it does not, your tape will be blown away.

The archive script is intended only for operator-initiated archiving of the 
main correlator data areas.  Private data or private tapes should be dealt
with directly using the tar command (see also linkdata).
