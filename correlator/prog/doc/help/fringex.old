COMMAND NAME:  fringex

SYNOPSIS:  segments output of fourfit

SYNTAX: fringex [-abcmfeoxiq] data file list
         [nsecs mode freq rate delay ra dec]
        -a phase is residual to corel+frnge model 
        -b phase is residual to corel use for closure phases 
        -c phase is total phase - geodetic definition
        -m phase is total earth centered for closure phases
           default=total earth centered phase 
        -f filter mode makes rate,delay,ra,dec offsets relative
           to corel - rather than relative to the fourfit peak 
        -e new (ver=2) format for aedit 
        -o shift segment by half segment duration
        -x to list default format
        -i output incoherent average (one noise corrected amp per scan)
        -q nsecs is in millisecs (special mode - times are ficticious)
        nsecs=coh.int sec=9999=default for full scan with corel epoch 
        a value of nsecs=integral number of APs is recommended
        mode=0  is non zero for special modes i.e. 402 for Lestrade
        mode=1 for old frngx format for caltech package
        freq (MHz) redefines the frequency 
        freq=-1 for reference frequency equal to channel nearest mean
        freq=-2 for reference frequency equal to mean 
        ra dec are position offsets in all modes
        in filter mode:
        rate=rate ps/s and delay=delay ns forces output to these
        values of rate and multiband delay plus any ra and dec offset
