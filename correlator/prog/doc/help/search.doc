SYNOPSIS:  Searches incoherently averaged A-file data for fringes

SYNTAX:  search [-d device] [-m msglevel] [-o outfile] [-x] filelist

OPTION FLAGS:	-d device
			Specifies the output graphics device for the
			contour plots of SNR in the delay/rate grid.
			The specification is in the standard PGPLOT form
			of filename/devicetype (e.g. test.ps/ps)

		-m msglevel
			Verbosity control parameter, ranging from -3 to +3,
			with lower numbers being more verbose.  The default
			value is 1.

ARGUMENTS:	filelist
			One or more input A-files which contain data generated
			by "average".  These data have been segmented and
