Summary of disk areas for VLBI data
-----------------------------------

To allow flexibility in periodic reconfigurations of disk resources, all
disk areas in the VLBI software system are pointed at by environment
variables.  The names of these environment variables will remain stable
at all times, and are used by a wide variety of programs and scripts.  If
you wish to construct robust procedures for processing your data, you
should use these environment variables as well, instead of the unix
pathname of the data directory.

Currently, there are two types of VLBI data storage area, operational and
scratch.  Respectively, these are used for operational correlator data
storage and archiving, and offline manipulation of restored datasets by
users.

The operational data areas, as far as the average user is concerned, look
like one single directory which contains all the data for currently active
experiments.  It is pointed to by the CORDATA environment variable.  However,
the data are in fact spread out over several physical disk areas, with
symbolic links from the $CORDATA directories.  Most people need not be
concerned with anything other than $CORDATA.  The operational data areas
are the sole repository of correlator data until the experiment is archived
to tape, so casual users are denied write access into these areas.  However,
many programs (which have internal safeguards against corrupting the data
structures) acquire write privileges in the operational data areas when
invoked, so casual users can perform fringe fitting, for example.  If you
wish to know the unix pathnames of the operational areas, check out the values
of $CORDATA and $DATA1 ... $DATAn.

The scratch data areas are writable by all, and are located in $SCRATCH1 to
$SCRATCHn, where n is currently 2.  When restoring an experiment to disk from
tape, you should put the data in one of these areas.  For the software to work
correctly with the restored data, you must set your environment variable
DATADIR to be the same as the appropriate $SCRATCHn.  If you want to work
with data in the operational areas, remember to reset it back to $CORDATA.
