COMMAND NAME:   ddstat

SYNOPSIS:  Verifies integrity and reports status of main data areas

SYNTAX:  ddstat [-a] [-t nnn] [expt1 expt2 ... exptn]
		Where all arguments are optional.
		Note: all option flags must appear before the experiment list

OPTION FLAGS:	-a
			Tells ddstat to report only those experiments
			which have data physically present on the disk

		-m pri
			Adjusts verbosity level.  The value 'pri' is an 
			integer from -3 to 3, lower is more verbose.
			The default is 3 (very quiet).

		-t days
			Tells ddstat to locate experiments which have
			been archived, and which have not been touched
			for a certain number of days, and move them to
			the long-term storage area defined by the
			OLDDATA environment variable.  This will help
			to keep the main data area uncluttered.

ARGUMENTS:	experiments
			You can optionally give ddstat a list of
			experiment numbers, and it will operate on only
			those.  The default is all experiments in the
			main data area pointed to by CORDATA.

ENVIRONMENT:	CORDATA, DATA1 ... DATAn, OLDDATA

DESCRIPTION:

This program is used to monitor the status of experiment directories, and to
check the integrity of the data areas.  At the present time, it is acquiring
various options and gaining in capabilities.  It is still hardcoded to the 
$CORDATA main data area, and cannot be used to report on other data areas.  
Future versions will have data area arguments.  

If the data areas pass a run of ddstat without errors, you can be pretty certain
that the data contained therein conform to all rules for correlator data file
naming conventions, symbolic linking between main and subsidiary data areas,
and other requirements.  The program checks rather thoroughly.
