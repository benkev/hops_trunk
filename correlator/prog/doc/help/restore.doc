Summary of procedure for retrieving data from tape to disk - MAT 23 April 94
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you need to restore an experiment which no longer resides anywhere on
disk in the unix system,  the procedure could fall into any one of three
categories,  depending on the age of the experiment:

Category 1

These are experiments which have made their way entirely through
the unix system,  and for which a unix tar archive tape exists.  
Any experiment which was processed in it's entirety after February
of 1993 will be in this category.  Tar archives for these experiments
are located on the top shelf of a bookshelf in Colin's Lonsdale's office
just to the right as you enter (Colin's office is the last on the right
in the "east wing" of the building).  The tapes are stacked by the Haystack
assigned experiment number.

Restoring data from these tapes is handled by the shell script "retrieve".
It will show you how much space is available: make sure you
have enough space to hold your entire experiment (a matter of some
guesswork,  but typically 200 Megabytes is enough for most experiments).

To work with the data,  be sure your $DATADIR environment variable points 
to the directory where your data resides.

Category 2

These are experiments which were processed between roughly September of
1983 and January 1993,  and reside only on traditional HP A900 savem format
archive tapes (either 9 track 6250 bpi reels or DAT's after Jan 27 1992).
The procedure for restoring experiments in this category is a bit more
involved (and baroque).  Please note then, that this is merely a very rough
outline of the procedure.  Expect in reality to deal with many potential
pitfalls and deeper levels of detail, depending on the size of the experiment
and available resources on the HP A900 computer. Also note that the following
description of the restore procedure assumes a working knowledge of the HP
A900 operating system.  To include a tutorial on every aspect of the procedure
at this time would be hopelessly voluminous.

First,  you must generate a type 52 listing of the scans you want to restore
(you may use the standard unix software tools to do this) in the standard
afile format (version 1).  Then you must decide whether you need to restore
type 51 (raw correlator) or type 52 extents.  Type 51's are needed if you
expect to do any re-fourfiting,  and type 52's only are needed if you only
need to look at fourfit/fringe plots and run fringex.  The afile list generated
must then be ftp'd over to the A900,  then fed to either one of two transfer
files;  *REFRN for restoring type 51's,  or *UNIB for type 52's.   Either of
these transfer files have their one major pitfall:

*REFRN - Before feeding the afile list you have created to this transfer file,
open the file with the HP editor and type 'tr,/cmdfiles/efind.fix'.  This 
rearranges some of the columns in the afile to the expected format.  If
you don't,  you will spend hours mounting tapes which will read in their 
entirety,  but restore no useful data - you have been warned !!

*UNIB  - Be sure to edit out any duplicate scans according to your own 
criterion,  otherwise the transfer file will do it for you.  If you include
duplicates intentionally,  they will be filtered out by the transfer file.

Restoring BOTH type 51's and their corresponding type 52's is not an automated
procedure and thus must be done somewhat by hand.  It might be easier and
quicker to consider restoring only the type 51's and re-fourfit on a fast
unix machine after the data is restored in this case.

Log on to the A900 and execute the appropriate transfer file.  Either of
them will ask lots of questions,  for which some the answers are obvious
and some not.  When it comes to mounting tapes, the A900 DATS are located
in metal drawers near the correlator console and the 9 tracks could be either
in an area near the telescope console (ask the correlator operator)  or down
the hill inside the radome of the Wesford telescope.  If you manage to get
through the restore process successfully, your data will then reside on an
an HP format cartridge on the A900.

Next, find out if an archive is in progress on the A900 by asking the
correlator operator.  If so,  wait for it to finish (if not,  proceed,
immediately), then execute transfer file *transfer.  This will transfer
the data from the HP format cartridge to the unix archiving area.  Within
1/2 an hour of the completion of the transfer from the A900 side (the
prompt returns to your terminal),  the data will begin appearing in the
standard data area on the unix system.  It should be completely transferred
in about 5 minutes.  At this point the data is available. 

If you are restoring type 51's for an entire experiment it is possible that
the experiment will take several interations of filling and transferring 
data on the A900.  This will complicate the procedure.


Category 3

These are experiments which were processed between roughly the beginning
of Mark III VLBI (Late 1979) to August 1983.  These archives are stored
on tar format Exabytes or DATS.  At this time there are no automated tools
available to extract, convert or filter these tapes, thus the procedure
must be done entirely by hand.  Until scripts are developed it is recommended
that the restoration of experiments in this category be left to a Haystack
person familiar with their format.
