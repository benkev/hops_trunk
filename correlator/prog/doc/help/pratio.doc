COMMAND NAME:   pratio

SYNOPSIS:  Computes scan-averaged ratios of cross and parallel hands

SYNTAX:  pratio [-m msglevel] filename

OPTION FLAGS:	-m msglevel
			Verbosity control parameter, ranging from -3 to +3,
			with lower numbers being more verbose.  The default
			value is 1.

ARGUMENTS:	filename
			This argument specifies the input dataset.  The name
			given is the root name of a set of up to four A-files,
			which contain scan-summaries of the four polarization
			correlation products.  The program will look for the
			four files "filename.xx", where "xx" is "RR", "LL",
			"RL" and "LR".  One or both of the parallel hand files
			should have the coherence time fields filled in, which
			will be propagated to the other polarizations.  The 
			program cannot check that the contents of the four
			files actually are the stated polarizations, so the
			input files must be carefully prepared.

ENVIRONMENT:	None


DESCRIPTION:

This program is responsible for forming various polarization ratios for 
polarization-sensitive mm-VLBI datasets.  The sequence of operations that
must be performed is (1) segment each correlation product to the same
coherence time, (2) form rl/ll, lr/ll, rl/rr, lr/rr, rr/ll ratios for each
segment, (3) compute vector scan averages for each ratio, and (4) write the
results out into a new A-file.  In order to process large datasets, it is
necessary to do a lot of sorting, to match up scans and segments, so pratio
makes multiple external calls to aedit, and keeps scratch files around on
disk.  It also must do the segmenting, which is handed off to fringex.  A
modest amount of computation is done internally, but the main function of
pratio is to automate a highly repetitive process that would be very 
time-consuming to do by hand, or via shell scripts constructed on an
experiment by experiment basis.  

In principle, the program should handle missing data in different
polarizations, and multiple experiment numbers, gracefully.

There is a lot of computation involved, and considerable file IO which could
be eliminated at the cost of increased complexity.  However, execution
times are not considered to be a major issue.
