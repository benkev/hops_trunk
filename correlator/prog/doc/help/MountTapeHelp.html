<P>
     The <B>Mount Tape Request</B> frame appears whenever the
Station Unit Manager (SUM) needs tape(s) mounted.  Normally
you need only mount the requested tape(s) on any available
drive(s); the SUM determines when tapes are correctly mounted
and reads bar-code labels to find which tape is on which drive. 
As this happens, this frame will empty, then disappear. 
<P> 
     Sometimes, however, the bar-code volume-serial-number
(VSN) label on a tape is not readable and/or the VSN is not in 
the vex file.  The <B>Mount Tape Request</B> frame remains with 
one or more question marks ("?") on a white background.  In 
this case, you need to send additional information about 
mounted tapes to the SUM.  Make sure that all tapes are
correctly mounted, then minimize your effort by typing SU
number(s) first.  Click just to the left of a question mark and 
type the correct number (this mini editor is in typeover mode), 
then Enter or Return to send this one line to the SUM.  (Changes 
you make outside the white area will be lost.)  This frame will
empty and then, perhaps, refill.  After typing all the needed SU 
numbers, if question marks remain under VSN, click just to the 
left of them and type the correct VSN, then Enter or Return. 
<P> 
     If a requested tape is not available (e.g., lost in the mail),
type a minus ("-") for its SU number and press Enter or Return 
to tell the SUM. 
<P>
     After the SUM is satisfied with all the tape information, the 
<B>Mount Tape Request</B> frame will go away.  If you right click in 
this frame while it is still displaying information, it will only 
iconify.
