COMMAND NAME:   Forclose

SYNOPSIS: 	Determines Single Band Delay, Multi Band Delay and Rate for
		scans on which no fringes are detected.  Uses closure on 
		detected baselines.

SYNTAX:  forclose [-tnfrc] list <snrmin>
          
		-t 	outputs all scans in each triangle with 1 weak baseline
    		-n 	produces BLOCKN/SEARCH output, specifying closure sbd
    		-f 	produces fourfit 'if' output, specifying closure sbd
    		-r 	lists weak baseline scans for type 51 recall purposes
    		-c 	outputs fourfit run lines with new windows in command line

OPTION FLAGS:	-t 	For each non-detected baseline that can be constrained
			by using closure on connecting detections, print out
			all three A-file summary lines.
			
                -n      For each constrained non-detection, print out a BLOCKN
			statement specifying a zero width SBD window.  This 
			format is suitable for use in a FRINGE control file.

                -f      For each constrained non-detection, print an 'if'
			statement specifying a zero width SBD window.  This
			format is suitable for use in a FOURFIT control file.

                -r  	Lists all A-summary lines for non-detected scans that
			can be constrained using closure.  This option used for
			type 51 recall purposes.

		-c  	For each constrained non-detection prints out a FOURFIT
			run line with zero width SBD window specified in the
			command line.  This format is useful for incorporation
			into shell scripts.

ARGUMENTS:	list
			A-list of all scans to be processed.  They must be in 
			time order with earlier scans first (this requirement
			will be relaxed in later versions).

		<snrmin>
			This optional parameter marks the dividing line between
			detections and non-detections.  The coherent SNR from
			FRINGE or FOURFIT is compared to this value.  If snrmin
			is a negative number the abs value is used as the snr
			limit AND only scans with quality factor 1-9 are 
			treated as detections.

					
ENVIRONMENT:	None.


DESCRIPTION:	Forclose makes use of the fact that residual rate and delay
		parameters found by the correlator, should add to zero around
		closed loops of baselines.  This allows us to constrain the
		fringe search for a low SNR scan.  Take, for example, the triangle
		ABC for which we have firm detections on baselines
		AB and BC.  No fringe is detected on baseline CA, but, using
		closure constraints we can determine where to look in rate,
		delay space.
		Forclose reads in the A-file until it digests all scans for a
		specific scan-time.  It then finds all triangles, determining
		which ones contain two detected baselines and one non-detection.
		For these, closure in enforced and the SBD is fixed and output
		in the desired format.  After this first iteration, the program
		attempts to constrain remaining non-detections by using the 
		new information from the constrained scans.  This continues until
		no more scans can be constrained.
