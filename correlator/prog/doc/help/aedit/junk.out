\underline{DESCRIPTION}
\begin{list}{}{\setlength{\leftmargin}{0.5in}
     \setlength{\rightmargin}{0in}}
\item
Sets flags in the data records according to a variety of
circumstances.  These flags can be selectively unset with
the "unflag" command.
\item
"Edit inputs" sets a flag bit in each data record for each
data selection input parameter which excludes that data point.
Thus, a scan may pass the input filter for stations, but fail
that for baselines.  The baseline bit would be set, but the
station bit would not.  Any set bit in the flag field causes
the scan to be flagged (i.e. it will not be plotted or written
to an output file).
\item
"Edit cursor" enables the cursor on an interactive graphics device
upon which data has been displayed using "plot".  The user may
type any character (except `x', `X', `a', `A', `b' or `B' ..  see 
below) on the keyboard to edit out the point nearest the cursor.
The cursor must be inside the border of a plot, and must be twice 
as close to the target point than any other point for success.  
Failure to meet these conditions results in an appropriate error 
message.    
\item
Alternatively, the user may define an area on the plot within which
all points are to be edited out.  This is accomplished by typing
`a' or `A' to locate the bottom left corner of a rectangle, and
`b' or `B' to locate the top right corner. 
\item
On devices which are not capable of erasing points from the screen
(e.g. tektronix emulators), the edited points are marked by being
overwritten by a solid square.
\item
Do not use the mouse buttons on workstation tektronix emulators - 
these return multiple characters which may confuse the program.
The cursor editing mode is terminated by typing the character `x' 
or `X' on the keyboard.
\item
"Edit duplicates" removes duplicate scans from the database, 
ignoring flagged scans.  The term "duplicate" refers to identical
baseline, scan time, frequency code, experiment number and source.
The second argument determines which scan aedit will retain.  If
"procdate" is specified, it will keep the most recent processing.
If "qcode" is specified, the "best" quality code scan is kept. If
"snr" is specified, the highest snr scan is kept.
\item
WARNING: Since "edit duplicates" ignores flagged scans, unflagging
data may generate more duplicates.  Similarly, reading in more
data may do the same.  In such circumstances, the recommended
course is to "unflag duplicates" and rerun "edit duplicates".
