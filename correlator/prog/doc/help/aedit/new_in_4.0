\underline{New in 4.0}
\end{center}

There have been many enhancements in ``aedit" since the release 3.0
in 1992, some of which are major, so I have decided to call this
release 4.0.  Below is a list of the most important enhancements.  The
detailed documentation of the individual commands covers the numerous
other, more minor changes.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Full support is now available for all three types of data record,
0, 1 and 2.  This applies to filtering, sorting, and other operations.
Two new ``edit" options are now available which remove data records
which lack parent or child data records (e.g. if a root record has no
associated corel or fringe records in the database, it can be edited
out with the command ``edit parents").  The ``family" sort option causes
data records to be grouped by root family when writing the data to disk
(normally, all type 2 records are written, then all type 1's, then all
type 0's).
\item Aedit now has significant experiment summary capabilities.  The
command ``ccread" causes a specified correlator control file to be read
into memory, after which one may invoke the ``psplot" command.  This is
a highly interactive experiment status browser and data editor, which
uses color-coded rectangles to represent data records.  You can tag or
edit data based on quality code, scantime or baseline, or by clicking on
individual data cells, and you can of course pop up fringe plots by 
clicking on any cell.  The display is intended to visually assist 
diagnosis of experiment-wide problems, among other things.
\item In order to circumvent the problem of limited numbers of parameters
in the standard A-file format, ``aedit" now supports parameter extraction
directly from the type-2 data files on disk.  Depending on circumstances,
you can now extract, plot, and write out any of a wide range of parameters.
You can also filter the data on the basis of the values of extracted parameters.
Phasecal information is now accessible only through the extracted
parameters.  The relevant commands are ``parameter", ``pwrite", ``plist"
and ``prange".
\item Plotting within ``aedit" has been improved significantly.  It is now
possible to plot any quantity, including extracted parameters if present,
against any other quantity (provided it makes rudimentary sense .. you
cannot plot closure rate versus baseline SNR, for example).  Specification
of the output device has been simplified for a subset of devices.  All
plots remain fully active, in the sense that on appropriate devices you can
edit data with the interactive cursor, or pop up fringe plots on Xwindow
devices.  New commands of relevance include ``xscale", ``yscale", ``reference"
and ``remote".
\item Along with all other MkIV programs, ``aedit" supports the new version 2
A-file format.  This format features a somewhat more useful mix of quantities,
with additional precision in many cases, and is to be preferred where
possible.  ``Aedit" can write the data out in any A-file format (see the
command ``outversion").
\end{enumerate}
