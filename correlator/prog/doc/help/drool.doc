Documentation for the script "drool", CJL, March 28 1995

COMMAND NAME:   drool

SYNOPSIS:  Garbage collector and error reporter for "dribble" mode

SYNTAX:  drool

OPTION FLAGS:	None

ARGUMENTS:	None

ENVIRONMENT:	TRANSFER DATAHOST


DESCRIPTION:

This script looks for .error files in the $TRANSFER directory, which get
generated by the "dribble" script when errors occur in the data transfer
from the HP1000 computer (see vhelp monitor).  When it finds these .error
files, it reports the offending data file root family and the reason for
failure, then moves the associated files to $TRANSFER.errors.  These
problem files will accumulate in the errors directory, and are meant to
be investigated manually.

The idea behind this scheme is that the data transfer monitor will complain
whenever it finds a root family with a .error file attached to it.  Thus,
when an error occurs, messages will appear every 60 seconds in the monitor
window.  To get rid of these messages, a human must explicitly run the
"drool" command, and be informed of the reason for the failure.  It is to
be hoped that this will prompt the abovementioned human to investigate
further.
