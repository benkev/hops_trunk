Unix-based A-file format                Documentor CJL, 28 January 1994
-----------------------                 -------------------------------

Below is a description of the A-file format, version 2 and higher.  Version 2
was introduced for two purposes.  First, deficiencies in the old format
were fixed.  Various useful quantities were added, and the scan time
precision was improved to 1 second, allowing trivial construction of
a unique unix data file name from the A-file line.  Second, a mechanism
for future support of A-file format evolution was included via the
version number in field 1.

A ground rule is that the new format is field-oriented, not column-oriented.
Fields are delimited by spaces.  In general, A-file format writing routines
will stick to the same columns to facilitate viewing of the files, but these
columns are NOT fixed, and any software that uses these files will not care
about the columns.  Many fields, however, will normally have fixed widths 
(indicated by definite number of characters in the width column below).
Extreme values in any field cause the field width to expand.  Common to all
lines is a format version number in the first field.  A non-numeric
character implies version 1 (the old HP-1000 format).  Future modifications
to the format will increment this version number.  All unix software will
support all A-file format versions, including files with mixed formats.  In
the latter case, however, certain fields will be missing in certain lines,
and processing of those quantities may be blocked by programs that encounter
such mixed-format files.

Note that version 2+ or mixed format A-files CANNOT be used on the HP-1000
systems.  If you need to ship an A-file back there, for reprocessing perhaps,
it MUST be a version 1 A-file.  Control over the output format from the unix
programs is provided.

Below are the formal definitions of the formats for different line types,
format version number 4.

The contents of the type 0 lines are as follows:

Field # Contents                Width/type      Comments

Changes version 1 to 2: Deletion of the archive number (obsolete 
                        under unix), repositioning of the root id code, 
                        and addition of seconds precision to the scan.  
                        The FMGR file name is also dropped.
Changes version 2 to 3: None
Changes version 3 to 4: Added seconds precision to procdate
Changes version 4 to 5: Added scan ID, changed scan year to 4 digits, removed
                            corel version from procdate

Changes version 1 to 2: Repositioning of the root id code, addition of 
                        seconds precision to the scan, separating reference 
                        and remote drive numbers into two fields (in case 
                        they go over 9), omission of the scheduled scan start 
                        seconds (now in the scan field), and omission of 
                        correlation start/stop times and EQTs, which are not 
                        present in the root file, and therefore not accessible 
                        under unix.  The FMGR file name is also dropped.
Changes version 2 to 3: None
Changes version 3 to 4: Addition of field 13, and seconds precision to procdate
Changes version 4 to 5: Added scan ID, deleted extent number from field 4 (so
                         that version 5 is unusable for Mk3), 4-digit scan year
                         removed corel version from procdate

Version 5, below, was introduced in order to support Mk4.  Because version 4
will still be used for legacy Mk3 data, both versions are described here in

Changes from version 4 to 5: deleted mode, parent extents, corel version #
                             added polarization, 2-char qf/errcode, scan_id
                             changed scan year to 4 digits

The above is intended to fulfill data export needs, but is insufficient for 
astrometric purposes.
