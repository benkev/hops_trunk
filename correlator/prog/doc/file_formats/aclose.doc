The quality code is determined by a variety of tests:

a) A letter code from a constituent baseline propagates directly into the
   quality field for a closure triangle.  The precedence of the baselines
   when multiple letter codes are present is undefined.
b) When no letter codes are present, the lowest numerical quality code present
   on the three baselines is used as a starting point.  If the data are
   segmented and the baseline quality codes are zero, the closure quality
   code is started at 9 instead.  This number is reduced by one under each of 
   the following circumstances.
    i) Minimum and maximum scan lengths differ by more than 1%
    ii) Minimum and maximum scan lengths differ by more than 20%
    iii) Minimum and maximum number of freqs processed differ by more than 5%
    iv) Baselines were processed under different roots.

Wherever the comment says "Must be same on all baselines", the data line would never
be formed in the first place unless it were true.  This will be enforced by aedit.
