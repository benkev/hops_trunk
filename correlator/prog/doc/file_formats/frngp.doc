EXPLANATION OF FRNGE PRINTOUT:
  
PLOT#1 5 superimposed plots of: 
1] Fringe rate spectrum-plot symbols 123456789ABCDEFG give singleband delay 
     1 indicates a residual single band delay of -4 lags(-1 microsec at 2MHZ) 
     8 indicates a residual single band delay of-0.5lags
     9 indicates a residual single band delay of  0 lags
     G indicates a residual single band delay of 3.5lags
     X indicates a residual single band delay outside search range
     ^ value off top of plot
 Plot center +4 inches from left edge = 0 residual rate 
 Plot full scale amplitude given in units of 0.01% correlation
2] Single band delay resolution plot symbols + or = when outside search 
    Plot starts at 1 point from left edge and runs for 16 points
3] Multi-band delay resolution plot symbols * or # when outside search
    Plot center +4 inches from left hand edge =0 residual delay 
4] All points in 3-dimensional search that have SNR greater than 4 sigma
    Plot symbols 123456789ABCDEFG 
   which indicate the single-band delay as in the fringe rate spectrum
   plot.The delay rate of each point is plotted on the same scale as the
   fringe rate spectrum. The multi-band delay of each point is not indicated
   and while the amplitude of each point is scaled in units of 0.01% the
   points are NOT interpolated and can be as much as 36% low in amplitude.
   Points in this plot are plotted on a character replacement basis : that
   is if 2 points fall on the same point on the page the second point is
   plotted. However search points have priority and are not replaced by 
   points from any of the other plots.
5] Cross-spectrum amplitude and phase - only plotted if correlation 
   amplitude is greater than 100x0.01%. 
    Plot symbols L:UP 
          L indicates lower sideband
          : indicates D.C.
          U indicates upper sideband
          P indicates phase on scale -180 deg to +180 deg 
6] Expanded plot of rate spectrum - only plotted if there is a "B" error
   code. Scale is reduced by a factor of 2. Plot symbol is S. 
PLOT#2  superimposed time segmented plots of
1] Fringe amplitude and residual phase for each frequency 
    Plot symbols 123456789VWXYZ indicating phase and frequency #
          U indicates that upper sideband predominates
          L indicates that lower sideband predominates
          A indicates that both sidebands are equally represented 
   Scale: phase -180 deg to +180 deg ,amplitude full scale=10% full plot
         (phase is the residual to sum of COREL and FRNGE models, and has 
          been corrected for phase cal phases)
2] Fringe amplitude and phase for all frequencies coherently added
    Plot symbols P indicates phase and T indicates amplitude
3] Phase calibration phases by station and frequency
    Reference station plot symbols 123456789VWXYZ 
    Remote  station plot symbols   ABCDEFGHIJKLMN 
    TIME SEGMENTATION for these plots is 50 segments for a single frequency 
    processed, 11 segments for 7 frequencies and 6 segments for 14 freqs. 
    The first segment for each frequency,all frequencies combined and 
    phase cal phases is plotted on the relevant dividing grid.The first 
    segment starts at the start time indicated and the last segment stops 
    at the stop time indicated.

TOTAL PHASE DEG total observed phase at EPOCH given below 
                phase is positive when wavefront arrives at remote station late 
                this definition holds regardless of sideband and is consistent
                with the definition of delay
EPOCH HHMMSS. epoch for observables number in parenthesis is central epoch
              computed by FRNGE for accepted data - delay,rate and phase for
              this epoch are in output file but not on printout 
              (if there if an "*" in front of this time FRNGE was 
               with the option NOT to call VDELY and mean epoch 
               numbers will not be in output) 
                phase in parenthesis is total phase for an epoch
                given by the time a wavefront passes the reference
                station and arrives at the center of the earth at EPOCH.
                Thus the epochs are defined by a particular wavefront - 
                the same for all baselines - and not by universal time
                at the reference station. 
RESIDUAL PHASE DEG phase residual to the COREL model at EPOCH 
                   corrected for phase cal phases - to uncal phaseuncal=

                   residual phase corrected to an EPOCH at which the
                   wave front reaches the center of the earth.
AMP     correlation amplitude in units of 10000.Number in parenthesis is
        the incoherent sum of fringe amplitudes for each segment
        corrected for the theoretical noise i.e. reduced by the 
        factor 1+1/(2*(segment SNR)**2) 
QF= quality factor of the run,0= no fringes 3=poor,9=good 
            i.e. higher numbers indicate better quality 
QF quality factor starts at 9 and is reduced by:
       1 point if RMS PH/SEG >11.46 and theoretical RMS < 5.73
       2 points if RMS PH/SEG >22.92 and theoretical RMS <11.46 
the factor is further reduced by: 
       1 point if RMS AMP/SEG >20.00% and theoretical RMS <10.00% 
       2 points if RMS AMP/SEG >40.00% and theoretical RMS <20.00%
the factor is futher reduced by:
       1 point  if RMS PH/FRQ  > 11.46 and theoretical RMS < 5.73 
       2 points if RMS PH/FRQ  > 22.92 and theoretical RMS <11.46 
the factor is further reduced by: 
       1 point  if RMS AMP/FRQ  > 20.00% and theoretical RMS <10.00%
       2 points if RMS AMP/FRQ  > 40.00% and theoretical RMS <20.00%
any error condition sets the quality factor to  letter code in which
                      A= freqency sequence cannot be handled by FRNGE 
                         requires an FFT of more than 256 points

CALCULATION OF CLOSURE RATES DELAYS AND PHASES (for 3-stations A,B,C) 
(from numbers on frnge printouts) 
  
CLOSURE rate(in microsec/sec):
  
   Closure= rate(AB)-rate(AC)+rate(BC)+acel(BC)*delayg*1.0E-6+
            rate(AB)*rate(BC)*1.0E-6
            rates in microsec/sec,acel in microsec/sec/sec,delay in microsec
  
CLOSURE delay(in microsec): 
  
   Closure= delay(AB)-delay(AC)+delay(BC)+rate(BC)*delayg*1.0E-6
            delay in microsec, rate in microsec/sec 
  
CLOSURE phase (in rotations): 
  
   Closure= phase(AB)-phase(AC)+phase(BC)+rate(BC)*delayg*freq*1.0E-6 
            phase in rotations,rate in microsec/sec,delay in microsec 
            reference freq in MHZ.
            This expression omits aceleraion terms which can produce at most
            approx. 0.3 deg. error at 22GHz. Since observables are used no
            error results from incorrect values of source position,baselines
            or Apriori clocks.
   delayg= measured delay on baseline AB (delay(AB))  minus APRIORI clock 
               on baseline AB in microsec 
  
CAUTION:
   1] ALL BASELINES MUST BE PROCESSED WITH SAME EPOCH 
   2] FOR CLOSURE PHASES ALL BASELINES MUST BE PROCESSED WITH 
      SAME REFERENCE FREQUENCY
   3] IF MANUAL PHASE CAL PHASES ARE USED THEY MUST CLOSE or phases 
      must first be "uncalibrated" before deriving closure phase
NOTE: 
  1] Since aprioris close,residuals can be used in above expressions
     but totals must be used for correction term; aprioris only 
     close if the same source positions etc have been used on all baselines.
     That is baselines processed from same root file will have aprioris that
     close while those proceesed from different root files may not close. 
  
CLOSURE PHASES -alternate method of calculation(FRNGE PRG800509 and later)
  
   Closure phase=phase("(AB)")-phase("(AC)")+phase("(BC)")
                 phases  are earth center epoch phases which are in 
                 parentheses in printout. 
                 Note that this method of obtaining closure phase uses Apiori 
                 information to move the epoch and a 1 arcsecond error in 
                 source position or baselines can result in approx. 1 deg.
                 error at 22GHz.
