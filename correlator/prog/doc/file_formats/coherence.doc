Coherence analysis results format
---------------------------------

To automate the reduction of mm-VLBI data it is necessary to write out
the results of a coherence analysis operation in a machine-readable format.
This document describes the issues involved, and describes two key 
proposed formats.

The coherence properties of a dataset are determined by station-related
phenomena -- the atmosphere over a station, and the stability of the
station frequency standard.  A complete description of the coherence properties
of a dataset should therefore be possible using a station-based format.

However, the data with which the coherence properties must be analyzed
are baseline-based.  Assuming the baseline coherence properties have been
determined, some algorithm must be employed to attribute properties to
stations.  This algorithm will rely on some form of closure.  The manner
in which station properties combine to produce baseline properties
must be determined on theoretical grounds (e.g. if the coherence time
of station A is m seconds and of station B is n seconds, what is the
coherence time of baseline AB?  Is it (1/m^2 + 1/n^2)^(-1/2), or something
else?  What does one do when triangles are incomplete?  You can only
determine coherence times when the source is detected, so any algorithm
for figuring out what coherence times to use for all scans will
involve interpolation between calibrator scans.

Assuming these problems can be satisfactorily solved, a useful format
for the coherence times should mimic the correlator control file
schedule section.  For example:

 95 274 04 08 00  0420-014 A(15,10):B(20,10):C(6,4)
 95 274 04 13 10  0411+054 A(15,10):B(20,10)
 95 274 04 37 40  0411+054 A(15,10):B(60,20):C(10,6)

For each station, the first number in parentheses would be the fringe
search coherence time (for maximum SNR), while the second number would
be the maximum coherent integration time which ensures negligible
coherence loss, for visibility generation.

Feedback on coherence data must refer back to the baseline data.  The
obvious form for this is one plot per baseline/scan, with markers for
both the machine-determined baseline coherence times, and the coherence
times resulting from the station-based decomposition.  The former should
be user-modifiable via cursor operation.

The station-based decomposition should be a separate program to allow for
user customization of the baseline coherence times.  The format of the
baseline-based coherence data must therefore be specified.  An
augmented A-file format (version 4) seems appropriate, since we need to
modify it anyway to allow independent amplitude and phase SNRs.  One
could implement smoothing and other manipulation of the coherence data
in an upgraded aedit (or a standalone program) as an upgrade to the
initial mm-VLBI package implementation.
