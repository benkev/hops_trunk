Principal differences between FRNGE plots and fourfit plots    CJL 1/6/94
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Frequencies are labelled with alphabetic characters instead of numbers.
   This scheme follows through to the channel-by-channel plots and information
   on the lower half of the page.  These frequency identifiers are tied to
   the LO frequencies, and are used to identify the sideband pairs in the
   fourfit control file (keywords "freqs", "pcal_phases", etc.).  They are
   ordered the same way as the LO frequencies in the type 2400 record of the root.

2. The L, A, U indicators for lower, dual and upper sideband data in the 
   segmented amplitude plots on the lower page are replaced by -, * and +.
   This avoids possible confusion with the alphabetic phase indicators, with
   better visual separation of amplitude and phase.

3. The T character in the all-channel segmented amplitude plot on the lower
   page is replaced by 'A', to denote amplitude.  The 'P' remains, to denote
   phase.

4. The phasecal phase plots on the lower page are keyed by the frequency code
   letter.  Upper case means reference station, lower case means remote
   station.

5. The FMGR file name on the 5th line of top and bottom pages is replaced by
   the unix root extension code.

6. The start and stop times are calculated slightly differently.  There is no
   important consequence of this change, but see item 9 below.

7. Counts of CRC errors, time discards, slip syncs and so on are slightly 
   different, due to the order in which operations are done in fourfit versus
   FRNGE.  None of these differences are thought to be of any consequence.

8. The MODE quantity (next to SNR on the upper page) has a completely different
   meaning to the FRNGE number: it depicts the phase cal mode used at the
   reference and remote sites (N=normal, A=ap by ap, M=manual).

9. On the segmented plots on the lower page, the time span of the data is defined
   to be the interval between the first and last APs with valid time tags.  This
   definition differs slightly from FRNGE, so that the segmenting is somewhat
   different.  In particular, fourfit will tend to have more segments with no
   gap at the beginning or end, compared to FRNGE, on a dataset that starts
   producing good data late (or stops early).

10. The fringe rate spectrum on the upper plot is gridded onto the page in a
   slightly different fashion to FRNGE.  The changes are cosmetic only.  The logic
   that dictates which points in other singleband delay boxes make it onto the
   fringe rate plot also differs slightly from FRNGE.  The new algorithm is believed
   to be more accurate.

11. The horizontal axes of the plots on both pages are not labelled.

12. When less than 14 channels are present, fourfit leaves blank space on the lower
   page, below the segmented data plots.  FRNGE puts zeroes in this location.

13. Quality factors A, C and F are not supported yet (and may never be, depending
   on postprocessing strategy decisions to be taken).

14. At the bottom of the lower page, fourfit places the names of the control file
   used, and the full unix pathname of the output fringe file.  These replace the
   HP-1000 specific equivalent information found at slightly different locations
   on a FRNGE plot.

15. Fourfit does not separately list the manual phasecal values if used.  They can
   be found from the MODE value (item 8 above) and the channel PCALPH1 and 2
   numbers below the plot on the lower page.

16. When plotting the cross-power spectrum in the right-hand portion of the upper
   plot, fourfit overwrites any existing characters (i.e. unlike FRNGE, the entire
   cross-power spectrum is always visible).  Also, all phase points are plotted,
   regardless of the amplitude at that point.  By default, cross-power spectra are
   plotted when the scan SNR exceeds 100, rather than when the amplitude exceeds
   1 percent as in FRNGE.  Forced plotting of the spectrum is available through
   the -x option in fourfit.

17. OPT and SG in the extreme bottom right of the lower page are not filled in by
   fourfit (they are specific to FRNGE special modes).

18. The special 'B' error code expanded fringe-rate plot is not supported by 
   fourfit.

19. The STAT field just above the SNR on the upper page is omitted by fourfit.

20. For the most part, FRNGE and fourfit results agree numerically to high accuracy.
   Phases are normally within 0.1 degrees, and overall fringe amplitudes agree
   to typically 0.1 percent.  Slight differences in filtering result in somewhat
   larger discrepancies.  After extensive testing, differences in almost all cases
   are attributable to roundoff, and minor algorithmic differences that are
   fully understood. As of January 1995, we have modified the fractional bit
   corrections somewhat from the original frnge algorithm. The primary effect will
   be to the value of the single band delays.
