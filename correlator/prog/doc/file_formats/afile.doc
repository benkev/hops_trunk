A-FILE FORMAT 
  
General rules:
  1. Any line with a '*' in column 1 is a comment.
  2. Each field in a data line is separated by one or more spaces.
  3. A-files are all named #Axxxx where xxxx is a serial# assigned
     in order of generation.  Each A-file acts as a summary and index 
     for the corresponding set of "A" and "B" archive tapes.

FRNGE QUALITY CODE: 
  
Q= quality factor of the run,0= no fringes 3=poor,9=good
            i.e. higher numbers indicate better quality 
Q quality factor starts at 9 and is reduced by: 
       1 point if RMS PH/SEG >11.46 and theoretical RMS < 5.73
       2 points if RMS PH/SEG >22.92 and theoretical RMS <11.46 
the factor is further reduced by: 
       1 point if RMS AMP/SEG >20.00% and theoretical RMS <10.00% 
       2 points if RMS AMP/SEG >40.00% and theoretical RMS <20.00%
the factor is futher reduced by:
       1 point  if RMS PH/FRQ  > 11.46 and theoretical RMS < 5.73 
       2 points if RMS PH/FRQ  > 22.92 and theoretical RMS <11.46 
the factor is further reduced by: 
       1 point  if RMS AMP/FRQ  > 20.00% and theoretical RMS <10.00%
       2 points if RMS AMP/FRQ  > 40.00% and theoretical RMS <20.00%
any error condition sets the quality factor to  letter code in which
                      A= freqency sequence cannot be handled by FRNGE 
                         requires an FFT of more than 256 points
                      B= interpolation error check search range fringes 
                         may be on the edge of range
                      C= epoch error condition all frequencies not at same
                         epoch
                      D= no phasecal or manually entered phasecal values
                      E= single band delay residual too large CAUTION 
                         fringe amplitude may be more than 5% low 
                      F= no data found- dummy FRNGE output
                   Q=0= probability of false detection greater than 1.0E-9
                         i.e. NO FRNGES 
                   Q=1= one or more phase cal signals less than 1% or greater 
                         than 20% in voltage
                   Q=2= one or more channels have amplitude less than half
                         the strength of the coherent average and SNR.GT.20

CRITERIA FOR DATA EXPORT AND QF REPORTS 

Because there are processing duplicates in most experiments a choice has
to be made on which one to accept.The method of duplicate deletion used 
is to first sort the A file of all scans so that all duplicates are adjacent
and then RU,CLOSR,-64,File of all scans,File of last scan in each set of
duplicates. With this scheme the criteria of acceptance depends on the order
in which the duplicates are sorted. 

OLD METHOD: accepts most recent processing - used for astronomy 

SORT ORDER (MOST SIGNIFICANT FIRST ): 
 SCAN TIME(37:03,41:04),[SOURCE(46:08)],FREQ CODE(77:01),BASELINE(55:02), 
 PROC TIME(23:10) 

where [] indicates that this step is usually unnecessary i.e. there 
is normally only one source associated with one scan

      () Afile column # start : # columns 

NEW METHOD: accepts quality factors 8 & 9  with highest SNR -used for geodesy   

SORT ORDER (MOST SIGNIFICANT FIRST ): 
 SCAN TIME(37:03,41:04),[SOURCE(46:08)],FREQ CODE(77:01),BASELINE(55:02)  
 QFF(58:01),SNR(88:04),[PROC TIME(23:10)]   

where  QFF=2 for QF=8 and 9 
       QFF=1 for QF=7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0 
       QFF=0 for QF=letter codes  and fringe searches (NFREQ=1) 
       QFF is derived from Afile using EDIT commands
