Unix-based A-file format		Documentor CJL, 28 January 1994
-----------------------			-------------------------------

Below is a description of the A-file format, version 2 and higher.  Version 2
was introduced for two purposes.  First, deficiencies in the old format
were fixed.  Various useful quantities were added, and the scan time
precision was improved to 1 second, allowing trivial construction of
a unique unix data file name from the A-file line.  Second, a mechanism
for future support of A-file format evolution was included via the
version number in field 1.

A ground rule is that the new format is field-oriented, not column-oriented.
Fields are delimited by spaces.  In general, A-file format writing routines
will stick to the same columns to facilitate viewing of the files, but these
columns are NOT fixed, and any software that uses these files will not care
about the columns.  Many fields, however, will normally have fixed widths 
(indicated by definite number of characters in the width column below).
Extreme values in any field cause the field width to expand.  Common to all
lines is a format version number in the first field.  A non-numeric
character implies version 1 (the old HP-1000 format).  Future modifications
to the format will increment this version number.  All unix software will
support all A-file format versions, including files with mixed formats.  In
the latter case, however, certain fields will be missing in certain lines,
and processing of those quantities may be blocked by programs that encounter
such mixed-format files.

Note that version 2+ or mixed format A-files CANNOT be used on the HP-1000
systems.  If you need to ship an A-file back there, for reprocessing perhaps,
it MUST be a version 1 A-file.  Control over the output format from the unix
programs is provided.

Below are the formal definitions of the formats for different line types,
format version number 3.

The contents of the type 0 lines are as follows:

Field # Contents		Width/type	Comments
------- --------		----------	--------
1	Format version #	1/i		Non-numeric = version 1
2	Root id code		6/c		6-char lower case
3	File type (0)		1/i		Root file record
4	Extent #		2/i		Should always be zero
5	Size 			4/i		# of 256-byte records in file
6	Expt serial #		4/i		Part of filename
7	Procdate yyddd?hhmm	10/c		Corel run date, ? is corel version
8	Year of scan		2/i		Two-digit year
9	Scan time ddd-hhmmss	10/c		Equals scan directory name
10	Source name		8/c		Blank padded
11	Station list		variable/c	1 character per station

Changes version 1 to 2: Deletion of the archive number (obsolete 
                        under unix), repositioning of the root id code, 
                        and addition of seconds precision to the scan.  
                        The FMGR file name is also dropped.
Changes version 2 to 3: None


The contents of the type 1 lines are as follows:

Field # Contents		Width/type	Comments
------- --------		----------	--------
1	Format version #	1/i		Non-numeric = version 1
2	Root id code		6/c		6-char lower case
3	File type (1)		1/i		Corel file record
4	Extent #		2/i		Part of filename
5	Size			4/i		# of 256-byte records in file
6	Expt serial #		4/i		Part of filename
7	Procdate yyddd?hhmm	10/c		Corel run date, ? is corel version
8	Year of scan		2/i		Two-digit year
9	Scan time ddd-hhmmss	10/c		Equals scan directory name
10	Source name		8/c		Blank-padded
11	Baseline/QF		3/c		2-char baseline id and 1-char qcode
						Meaning of qcode in corel.doc
12	Scheduled duration	4/i		Seconds
13	Reference drive	#	1/i		
14	Remote drive #		1/i		
15	frequencies		2/c		E.g. SX
16	Reference clock error	7/f		Microsec
17	Ref/rem clock diff.	7/f		Microsec
18	Status bits		6/octal		See corel.doc for details

Changes version 1 to 2: Repositioning of the root id code, addition of 
                        seconds precision to the scan, separating reference 
                        and remote drive numbers into two fields (in case 
                        they go over 9), omission of the scheduled scan start 
                        seconds (now in the scan field), and omission of 
                        correlation start/stop times and EQTs, which are not 
                        present in the root file, and therefore not accessible 
                        under unix.  The FMGR file name is also dropped.
