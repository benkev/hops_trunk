COMMAND NAME:   coterp

SYNOPSIS:  Finds coherence times for coherently undetected scans

SYNTAX:  coterp [-x] [-d device] [-o outfile] [-m msglevel] fitlist masterlist
          
		-x	open x-window for graphics display
		-d	select graphics device
		-o	specify output file
		-m	set message level

OPTION FLAGS:	-d device  [Not yet implemented]
			Specifies the output graphics device for the plots
			of station coherence time.
			The specification is in the standard PGPLOT form
			of filename/devicetype (e.g. test.ps/ps)

		-m msglevel
			Verbosity control parameter, ranging from -3 to +3,
			with lower numbers being more verbose.  The default
			value is 1.

		-o outfile
			If specified, this flag directs the A-file output
			of cofit to the named file.  If omitted, coterp
			writes its output to stdout.

		-x
			Shorthand for "-d /xw", the xwindow display.

ARGUMENTS:	fitlist
			A-list of coherence fitted scans as output by cofit.
			Scans in this file are assumed to have already been
			processed by cofit which will have filled in no-loss
			and search coherence time fields.  These scans should
			be firm coherent detections since they will be used
			to find coherence times for non-detection scans.

		masterlist
			An A-list of all scans to be processed which includes
			not only the detections but also non-detections.
			The scans originally processed by cofit to produce
			the fitlist are included in masterlist.

ENVIRONMENT:	None.


DESCRIPTION:	For purposes of fringe searching and for evaluating
		visibility amplitude, one needs to know the coherence
		time of the data.  The program COFIT determines these
		times for scans which have already been detected by
		coherent averaging methods (such as the program FOURFIT).
		COTERP uses the values determined in COFIT to interpolate
		coherence times on baselines for which fringes are not yet
		detected.  To do this, COTERP first uses a least squares
		algorithm to 'stationize' the baseline based coherence
		times from COFIT.  For a given scan time, this results
		in a coherence time for each station which is descriptive
		of the atmospheric turbulence above a given station at a
		given elevation.  The algorithm to stationize the coherence
		times makes the assumption that the inverse square of a
		baseline coherence time is equal to the sum of inverse
		squares of the station coherence times.

		Each station coherence time is then adjusted using a
		theoretical elevation dependence to take into account
		the coherence change with time.  Once this is done, the
		adjusted station coherence times are interpolated for
		the unfitted scans in the masterlist.  The final step
		inverts the coherence time relation above to calculate
		baseline coherence times from the interpolated station
		based times.  All scans in the resulting output file will
		have either coherence times determined by COFIT (previous
		detections) or coherence times interpolated by COTERP
		(previous non-detections).
