DESCRIPTION:

Fearfit is a (at present a) minimally hacked version of fourfit which
contains a few extra bits of functionality which is entirely triggered
by the setting of certain environment variables.  Their names and use
is as follows:

    HOPS_FEARFIT_XPSPEC
        If set to an integer greater than zero, the cross-power
        spectrum is output to a file named "fearfit.spec".  Used
        to export the spectral data to an external program, such
        as gnuplot.

    HOPS_FEARFIT_SDELAY
        If set to an integer greater than zero, the single-band
        delay data is output to a file named "fearfit.sdly".  This
        is used to export the SBD data to an external program, such
        as gnuplot.

    HOPS_FEARFIT_BEFORE
    HOPS_FEARFIT_AFTER
    HOPS_FEARFIT_FACTOR
    HOPS_FEARFIT_FREQLO
        Collectively control the rotation of the spectrum by
        an arbitrary angle.  When HOPS_FEARFIT_BEFORE and/or
        HOPS_FEARFIT_AFTER are set, the spectrum is output to a
        file "fearfit.data" either before or after the rotation.
        The HOPS_FEARFIT_FACTOR should be a double giving us/s
        of drift, and HOPS_FEARFIT_FREQLO (if set) provides a
        replacement for the reference frequency (which is the
        default).

    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_VERB
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_NOMAST
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_SWAP
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_MEDFR
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_POLICY
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_NCHAN
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_DERATE
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_DELTA
    HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_ZPHS
        These control a diagnositic message that is output when the
        pc mode is manual.  The normal fourfit (-m1) calculates the
        pc_phases required to bring the multiband delay to zero.
        This version does that, and additionally calculates delay
        offsets (used with delay_offs) to adjust the single band delays.

        The output format is suitable for inclusion in a control file,
        and comments are generated to provide more informative details.
        You may use the "samplers" keyword to define bands that should
        be delayed collectively (which is what makes the most sense).
        The current implementation does the math independently of the
        plot, but still respects the -f and -n command line options.

        HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_VERB functions as a msg level for this
        output (the default is 2, raise it for less output, lower it
        for more ouput; 3 or higher makes this mode fall silent).

        HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_NOMAST controls some of the initial
        output: set this to 1 to turn off the zero spewage on the
        station not getting phases or delays, and set it to 2 to
        to turn off the file, baseline and snr commentary as well.

        HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_SWAP (if set) flips the signs on the
        phases and delays and assigns these to the remote, rather
        than to the reference station.  A no-phase, no-delay report
        is made for the other station.

        HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_MEDFR allows you to set a fraction of the
        channels which are considered to be reliable for setting the
        delay_offs values.  That fraction about the median is used to
        estimate an averaged delay for the sampler group, those outside
        the median are assigned the median value and in any case the
        average of all channels is suggested.

        Typically you will find some gap between these delays that you
        want to try to close.  The following variables address attempts
        to try to do that--they give you tools, but no sure solution.

        HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_POLICY can be set to 0, 1 or 2 to specify
        that the upper band is to be shifted, the lower band is to be
        shifted, or both are to be brought together (the default),
        respectively.  You can also specify policy 3 which does nothing.
        (You will end up in this case if the following inputs are illegal.)
        There is a gap estimation process that attempts to determine
        the size of the gap (in degrees).  Normally the two channels on
        either side of the gap are used to extrapolate to the midpoint
        between the samplers using a linear fit.

        HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_NCHAN can be set to 3 or more to give up
        on this linear fit near the gap and merely substitute an average
        of the channels on each side.  This is better for noisy phases.

        HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_DERATE may be used as a multiplier on the
        result.  (I.e. it may be that the automatic method systematically
        over- or under- estimates the size of the gap.)

        HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_DELTA is available as a final increment to
        the gap adjustment.  You need to set this to 0.0 to activate
        the gap closing machinery.  (Otherwise you'll be left with the
        pc phases such as fourfit would have given you.)

        HOPS_FEARFIT_PCPHASE_ZPHS adjusts all phases by this amount.

    HOPS_FEARFIT_MBDGRID
    HOPS_FEARFIT_MBDTOL
        The former is presently not connected (but present for tracking).
        The latter may be set to specify a tolerance for matching
        frequencies to the grid.  The default is 0.001 (i.e. 1 kHz),
        and with normally spaced channels works in most cases.  If the
        frequency spacing is irregular, this may result in an inordinately
        large number of points in the MBD search grid.  You can relax
        this by setting HOPS_FEARFIT_MBDTOL to a larger value.  Note
        that the original method is still used, and only tries again
        if HOPS_FEARFIT_MBDTOL is nonzero.

None of the fearfit features are guaranteed to survive, or to perform
consistently.  However, inertia is your friend....
