COMMAND NAME:   monitor

SYNOPSIS:  Handles data flowing from HP1000 computer in "dribble" mode

SYNTAX:  monitor

OPTION FLAGS:	None

ARGUMENTS:	None

ENVIRONMENT:	DATAHOST, OPDISPLAY, TRANSFER, CORDATA, DATA1 ... DATAn


DESCRIPTION:

This script is designed to handle the quasi-realtime data flow from a MkIII
or MkIIIA correlator controlled by HP1000 computers.  The behaviour of the
script is controlled via environment variables, as described below.

When invoked, "monitor" will check the environment, check for another copy
of itself which may already be running, and if all is well, start up a
hpterm window on the display $OPDISPLAY.  The monitor command must be issued
from the $DATAHOST machine.

In the hpterm window, the "dribble" command is automatically issued.  The
dribble script goes into an infinite loop, waking up every 60 seconds to look
for data files newly transferred to the $TRANSFER disk area via ftp from the
HP1000 computer.  The dribble command should not be issued manually, and
will refuse to start unless invoked by "monitor".

When "dribble" encounters data from the correlator, it performs a variety of
checks, and invokes "rename -d" (see vhelp rename for details).  This causes
the data files to be carefully examined, and then renamed into the standard
unix filenaming convention.  The data are sent to the main data areas pointed
to by $CORDATA and $DATA1 ... $DATAn.  Upon successful completion of this
operation, the data are test-fourfitted, and the results of this fringe
fit are displayed in the monitor window.  A completion code is then ftp'ed
back to the HP1000 computer as confirmation of transfer, so that the data can
be purged.  

If, however, there were any problems with the process, an error code is
sent back to the HP1000 instead.  A .error file is generated, which sits in 
the $TRANSFER directory, causing an error message from "dribble" every 60
seconds.  These error files and their associated data files may be transferred
to the directory $TRANSFER/errors for later examination by using the script
"drool" (see vhelp drool).

If the data monitor dies for some reason, the hpterm window will disappear.
To interrupt the monitor, type control-C in the monitor window.  However, to
avoid corrupt data, DO NOT under any circumstances do this while the monitor
is actually in the process of renaming files (i.e. make sure it is in a
dormant state).

Each time the monitor starts up, all text in the monitor window is logged into
a file of the form $TRANSFER/monitor.yyddd-hhmmss, where the time refers to 
the issuance of the "monitor" command.  The logging to this file is buffered
by the system, so will not be completely up to date at any given time.  When
the monitor is killed with a control-C (see previous paragraph), the buffer
is flushed and the log is completed.
