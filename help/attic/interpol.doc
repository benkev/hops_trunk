COMMAND NAME:   interpol

SYNOPSIS:  Interpolates fringe search parameters for non-detections and outputs
	   either a-file format or windows for fourfit control files.

SYNTAX:  interpol [-ft][-s sbd win] [-b mbd win] [-r rate win] [-m msglevel]
			[-o outfile] [-l snrlim] [-e exp] input_file(s)
		-f prints out non-detection scans in a-file format
		-t prints out all scans with interpolated values in a-file format.
		-s specifies width of sbdelay window in usec (default = 0).
		-b specifies width of mbdelay window in usec (default = 0).
		-r specifies width of dela rate window in ps/s (default = 0). 
		-m sets verbosity level
		-o specifies output file (default is stdout).
		-l sets snr limit below which scans are labeled non-detections
		-e sets exponent used in fitting routine
		input_file(s) is(are) mandatory.

OPTION FLAGS:	-f
			Default operation of interpol is to output new windows
			for refringing in fourfit control file format.  The 'f' 
			option outputs all those scans for which new windows
			were found in a-file format.  This output can drive
			fourfit in the (-r) mode.

		-t
			To actually see the interpolated lines, it is useful to
			output all scans in a-file format with interpolated
			values filled in for sbd, mbd, rate.  Output from the
			't' option can be fed into AEDIT and plotted along with
			the original input file to check goodness of fit and
			to look for outliers.

		-s sbd window width
			Sets the width of a window with which to pad the 
			interpolated value of sbd.  New windows will be centered
			on the new value with a TOTAL extent of the value
			specified here.

		-b mbd window width
			Same as the 's' option but for the multi-band delay
			parameter.

		-r rate window width
			Same as the 's' option but for the delay rate parameter.

		-m msglevel
			The lower the msglevel number, the more verbose the program
			gets.  The default is 1, and the range -3 to +3 is supported.

		-o outfile
			If this flag is specified, the program will write its 
			output to the specified file.  If not, it will write to 
			stdout.

		-l snrlimit
			Interpol bases its linear fit only on those scans which 
			pass through a quality filter.  This filter checks that
			the quality factor is 1 or greater and that the snr of
			the scan is greater than the snrlimit specified with the
			'l' option.  Default is 7.
		-e exp
			When finding the best fit line, the user has some choice 
			of weights used in the fit.  A value of e=2 corresponds
 			to least squares weighting while e=0 gives all points the
			same weight.  e= exponent of snr used as weight.

ARGUMENTS:	input_file(s)
			These are the names of the Afile(s) to process.  They need 
			not be sorted in any way and may include any type of afile
			summary line.  Only the type 2 (fringe) lines will be 
			considered by interpol.  Currently, interpol does require 
			that only one frequency be processed at a time.

ENVIRONMENT:	None


DESCRIPTION:

It is frequently the case that we can learn where to search for a VLBI detection by 
examining detections at earlier and later times on the same baseline.  To do this
requires an interpolation scheme that bridges the gaps between detections.  In the
extreme case, an experiment will produce fringes on the calibrator sources but 
none on the target sources.  In this case, one has to interpolate the fringe search
parameters (single-band delay, multi-band delay, delay rate) based on the calibrator
detections.  

Interpol reads in a file of a-file summary lines, and selects only those of type 2.
After an internal sort it selects those scans that pass through a detection filter.
A scan is a 'detection' if its quality code is greater than 1 and its snr is above
the value set by the '-l' option (default = 7).  These detections are fit to a straight
line and the non-detections are assigned new search windows based on these fits.
The default mode of interpol outputs search windows in fourfit control format that 
are centered on the interpolated values and with a width set by the user in the 
control line.  One can also output all scans (including detections) with the interpolated
values in a-file format for plotting in aedit.  To refringe interpolated scans with 
fourfit it may be desirable to have a list of the original non-detections that interpol
found new search values for.  The output of the '-f' option does this and can be used
to drive fourfit in its '-r' mode.
