COMMAND NAME:   fourfit

SYNOPSIS:  Performs fringe searching for MkIV data

SYNTAX:  fourfit [-a] [-b BB:F] [-c controlfile] [-d display device]
	    [-m value] [-o delay offset] [-r afile] [-stux] data file list 
	    [set <control file syntax statements>]
		 Where all arguments except the data file list are optional.
		 The [-r afile] option replaces the data file list, however.
		 The "set" argument and the commands which follow it must
		 come last.  All option flags must appear before the data file
		 list.  Option flags can come in any order.

	Here are two examples of command-line invocations of fourfit, with
	an explanation of what they do:

fourfit -txas -m 1 -c control 018-234505 set mb_win -0.0034 .004 freqs a b
		Test mode, xwindow display, accounting switched on, cross power
		spectrum plot switched on, moderately verbose, use control file
		named "control" in current working directory, process all data in
		scan directory 018-234505, override multiband delay search
		window and select channels 'a' and 'b' only.

fourfit -r refr_list -c control -d hardcopy -b AT:S
		Process all data referenced by type 2 lines in the A-file named
		"refr_list", use control file "control", print the fringe plot 
		on the default printer, process only baseline AT frequency 
		subgroup S. 

OPTION FLAGS:   -a
			If specified, this option switches on accounting
			of CPU time and wall-clock time used in the various
			parts of fourfit.  When the program finishes, it
			produces a summary of these timing statistics.

		-b BB:F
			Allows the user to override the control file
			with a specification of the baseline and/or
			frequency group to be processed.  The syntax is
			flexible.  0, 1 or 2 characters before the colon
			refer to the baseline (one character is interpreted
			as a station), and 0 or 1 character after the colon
			is interpreted as the frequency subgroup.  You can
			use the control file wildcard character '?' in
			the baseline, but remember to protect it from the
			C-shell either by escaping it with a backslash '\'
			or enclosing the entire -b argument in single
			quotes.  If you wish only to specify the baseline,
			the colon may be omitted.  An error in the -b
			flag argument causes the flag to be ignored, and
			fourfit will continue execution.

		-c controlfile
			Specifies the file which contains parameters
			to control the operation of the program.  If
			absent, fourfit will use only the file pointed to
			by the environment variable DEF_CONTROL, which
			in turn defaults to $FF/cf_default as defined
			in the $HOPS/setup.csh file.  Any parameters
			set in a control file specified with the -c option
			override the default file values.  A description
			of the syntax of the control file, with an example,
			can be found later in this document.

		-d display_device
			Upon completion of a fringe-fit, fourfit can
			optionally display the results in graphical form.
			At present, the only form of output is the
			traditional fringe plot (somewhat modified from
			the FRNGE version).  It can be presented in three
			ways:  In an X-window popup, in a disk file, and
			as hardcopy.  The corresponding values of the
			string 'display_device' are "xwindow", "diskfile",
			and "hardcopy".  For "xwindow", be sure to set
			your DISPLAY environment variable appropriately.
			The "diskfile" option is currently hardcoded to the
			filename "temp.fplot" in the current working
			directory.  The hardcopy option sends the plot to
			a printer under control of the script
			"/usr/local/bin/fplot_print".  At Haystack, this
			currently uses the printer named "east".

		-m value
			This flag controls the verbosity of the program via
			the integer argument "value", which ranges from 3
			(virtually silent except for major errors) to -3 
			(incredibly verbose, of use only to the authors of 
			the program).  The default is 2.
			

		-o nnn
			The fringe search algorithm in fourfit is not yet
			and may never be equipped to handle spectral line
			data.  The input data files are expected to contain
			8 lags, as in a standard continuum correlation.
			When it is desired to read in and manipulate data
			with more lags than this, the -o flag allows selection
			of a subset of 8 lags, so that the rest of fourfit
			can treat the data sensibly.  The number "nnn"
			corresponds to the delay offset in lags of the center
			of the lag range to pass the filtering of the data.
			Specifically, fourfit will process the lag range
			between nnn-4 and nnn+3, inclusive.

		-r afile
			Puts fourfit into "refringe" mode.  Fourfit refringing
			is driven by an A-file input, which overrides any 
			correlator root files directly specified on the command
			line (i.e. the latter are ignored when the -r flag
			is specified).  The input A-file, of which there can
			be only one, may contain root, corel or fringe lines,
			but only the fringe lines are used to determine which
			data to process, by baseline and frequency subgroup.
			Obviously, the -r flag is inconsistent with the -u
			flag, and specifying both is an error.  Note that for
			afiles using HP-1000 (version 1) line formats, fourfit
			has to pre-check the disk for the existence of the 
			type 2 files.  The data area is controlled by the
			DATADIR environment variable.  It defaults to the
			value of $CORDATA.

		-s
			By default, the cross-power amplitude and phase are
			plotted only when the SNR exceeds a threshold value (100).
			This option causes the spectrum to be plotted regardless
			of SNR.

		-t
			This flag places fourfit in test mode.  Everything
			works as normal, except that the output file is not
			written to disk, and the root file is not updated.
			This is useful when experimenting with different
			fringe-fitting strategies, in order to avoid cluttering
			up the disk.

		-u
			Normally, fourfit processes all data consistent with
			the data file list and the control information.  When
			this flag is specified, fourfit will also check the
			information in the type-2100 record of the root to 
			see if the data have already been processed by fourfit.
			If so, the data in question are skipped.  The "u"
			stands for update mode.

		-x
			Shorthand for -d xwindow.

ARGUMENTS:	data file list
			This mandatory argument or arguments tells fourfit
			which data files to process.  The format of the data
			file specification is the standard one for all MkIV
			software.  You may specify individual filenames, 
			scan directories which contain data files, 
			experiment directories, or any combination of
			these three.  In the latter two cases,
			fourfit will descend the directory tree looking for
			data files to add to its internal list of files to
			process.  Only root files need be specified.  The
			data files actually fringe-searched are determined
			by the combination of the root files specified and the
			restrictions imposed by the control file or control
			parameter list (see below).  In the absence of 
			such restrictions, all data associated with the 
			specified root files are processed.

			Beware of trying to specify too many
                        files or scan directories, as it is possible to
                        overflow the Unix argument list buffer on large
                        experiments.  In such cases, specify the experiment
                        directory instead.

		set <control file syntax statements>
			This command line argument is optional, and
			is intended to permit rapid, temporary modification
			of 'fourfit' behaviour without the need to edit the
			control file.  The word "set" tells fourfit to expect
			additional control information on the rest of the
			command line.  The syntax of this control information
			is identical to that of the control file (see
			detailed description below).  The control file
			parser will detect syntax errors and abort if you
			do not follow the rules as laid down.  The control
			information you specify after the "set" argument
			on the command line applies to all data to be
			processed, and overrides whatever the control file
			itself specified for the parameters in question.

ENVIRONMENT:	DEF_CONTROL, DISPLAY, DATADIR

DESCRIPTION:

fourfit is the functional analogue of FRNGE on the HP-1000 systems, and searches
the data represented by the root and corel files for fringes, writing the results
of the search to files of type fringe.  The emphasis in the design of the
program has been speed and flexibility, particularly with regard to future
enhancements.  Algorithmically, the program is closely modelled on FRNGE, with
only minor enhancements as yet, based on the availablity of greater computing
resources.

Below is a preliminary form of a document describing in detail the format and

KEYWORD SEMANTICS

**scan selection**

   skip          if this is set to true in the body of an if_block, then 
		 any scans matching the if conditions will be skipped. Note: as of
         99.2.19 fourfit will not properly skip data if f_group is specified.

**filtering**    determines whether or not each AP is accepted

   max_parity    maximum allowable fraction of bytes in error
   x_slip_sync   maximum # of frames w/ re-sync in reference station
   y_slip_sync      "    "  "    "   "     "     " remote      "
   x_crc         either keep or discard AP if reference time has CRC error
   y_crc           "      "   "    "    "  "  remote      "   "   "    "
   freqs         controls which frequency channels get included in the fit.
		 The letters a-p correspond to the order that the frequencies
		 appear in the root file. With no suffix, DSB is implied, if
		 both sidebands are present. A plus suffix denotes USB, a
		 minus is used for LSB.
   index         alternate method used to select data channels, based on the
		 original corel index number. Not as well supported as freqs,
		 and is current being phased out.
   start         start time for data to be included.
   stop          stop    "   "    "  "   "    "

	 Arguments of start and stop are integers with an optional minus sign. A
	 positive integer is interpreted as an absolute time in seconds past the
	 hour (of the scan start time). When a minus sign precedes the start time
	 it is considered to be a time relative to, and later than, the
	 scheduled scan start. Similarly, a negative stop time precedes the
	 scheduled scan stop time, by the indicated number of seconds.

   switched      turns on (frequency) switched mode, which discards some AP's
		 and keeps others, depending on a gating waveform
   period        period in seconds of the gating waveform
   gates         for each freq. channel, the starting delay and duration, in
		 seconds, of the gating waveform
   passband      specifies in MHz the edges of a passband, outside of which
                 all data will be discarded, at the stage when cross-power
                 spectra are formed
   
**search**       control the fringe-searching process

   sb_win        single band delay search window bounds, in us
   mb_win        multiband     "     "      "       "     "  "; if the upper
		 bound (2nd number) is less than the lower bound (1st number),
		 then fourfit performs a "wrap-around" search, in order to handle 
		 the case of a delay near to the multiband (semi-) ambiguity.
   dr_win        delay_rate search window bounds, in us/s
   ra_offset     apply right asc.offset (asec) to re-center search windows
   dec_offset      "   declination  "   (asec) "      "        "      "   

**corrections**  apply corrections to the data, either before or after fit

   pc_mode       specify whether phase_cal mode is normal (model linear in
		 time is extracted from the data), manual (specified totally 
		 by the user), or ap_by_ap (phase cal is extracted independently
		 for each AP)
   pc_phases     phase_cal phases in deg, for each of the listed freq channels;
		 these offset phases are added to the underlying model, as
		 specified by pc_mode, above
   lsb_offset    additive phase in degrees, for the LSB relative to the USB;
		 often necessary when correlating VLBA data against Mk 3
   ref_freq      specifies a frequency in MHz at which the phase delay
		 is determined (default is total LO of first frequency)
   adhoc_phase   specify mode of ad hoc phase corrections. No corrections
		 are made if this isn't present, or is set to false.
   adhoc_period  For ad hoc sinewave model; the period in integer seconds.
   adhoc_amp      "   "  "     "       "    amplitude in degrees of phase.
   adhoc_tref    For both ad hoc phase models; the reference time in seconds
		 past the most recent hour.
   adhoc_poly    For the ad hoc phase polynomial model; From 1-6 coefficients
		 describing a power-series model in time. (deg/sec^n)


SPECIAL KEYWORD VALUES
   ?         wild card character
   keep      32767
   discard       0
   true          1
   false         0
   


SPECIAL FORMATS
   UT-epochs: 
         UT-epochs are expressed in the format ddd-hhmmss, where all 10
	 characters are necessary, including leading 0's if appropriate.
	 This format will match that of a scan directory, if the UT-epoch
	 that is being specified is an actual scan time.


GENERAL GUIDELINES

   1) White space is ignored; i.e., multiple spaces and line feeds all
      collapse to a single space.
   2) Multiple commands per line are fine.
   3) Comments: anything from an asterisk through the end of the line
      is ignored.
   4) Nested ifs are not allowed (or necessary). Nested parentheses in
      an if condition are fine (NYI).
      As of 94.1.16, parentheses are not supported. The logical operators,
      in decreasing order of precedence are (not, and, or).
   5) Wildcard "?" matches any single character for f_group, station, or
      baseline, any string (of up to 8 characters) for source, and any
      time-value for scan.
   6) Phase cal is normally treated station by station. 
   7) Only freqs that are chosen for both stations in a baseline are 
      present in the fit.
   8) If multiple if-blocks match a particular passes' choice of baseline,
      f_group, source, and scan criteria, then the later values assigned
      to each parameter overwrite the earlier ones.




The output of fourfit differs in some ways from FRNGE.  Below is a list of most
of the key differences in the fringe plot:


Principal differences between FRNGE plots and fourfit plots    CJL 4/11/94
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Frequencies are labelled with alphabetic characters instead of numbers.
   This scheme follows through to the channel-by-channel plots and information
   on the lower half of the page.  These frequency identifiers are tied to
   the LO frequencies, and are used to identify the sideband pairs in the
   fourfit control file (keywords "freqs", "pcal_phases", etc.).  They are
   ordered the same way as the LO frequencies in the type 2400 record of the root.

2. The L, A, U indicators for lower, dual and upper sideband data in the 
   segmented amplitude plots on the lower page are replaced by -, * and +.
   This avoids possible confusion with the alphabetic phase indicators, with
   better visual separation of amplitude and phase.

3. The T character in the all-channel segmented amplitude plot on the lower
   page is replaced by 'A', to denote amplitude.  The 'P' remains, to denote
   phase.

4. The phasecal phase plots on the lower page are keyed by the frequency code
   letter.  Upper case means reference station, lower case means remote
   station.

5. The FMGR file name on the 5th line of top and bottom pages is replaced by
   the unix root extension code.

6. The start and stop times are calculated slightly differently.  There is no
   important consequence of this change, but see item 9 below.

7. Counts of CRC errors, time discards, slip syncs and so on are slightly 
   different, due to the order in which operations are done in fourfit versus
   FRNGE.  None of these differences are thought to be of any consequence.
   In fourfit, some of the records are discarded early, before errors other
   than bad time tags can be detected.

8. The MODE quantity (next to SNR on the upper page) has a completely different
   meaning to the FRNGE number.  The pc mode indicators are a single character
   for the reference station, followed by one for the remote station. The possible
   characters are N (normal), A (ap_by_ap mode), and M (manual).

9. On the segmented plots on the lower page, the time span of the data is defined
   to be the interval between the first and last APs with valid time tags.  This
   definition differs slightly from FRNGE, so that the segmenting is somewhat
   different.  In particular, fourfit will tend to have more segments with no
   gap at the beginning or end, compared to FRNGE, on a dataset that starts
   producing good data late (or stops early).

10. The fringe rate spectrum on the upper plot is gridded onto the page in a
   slightly different fashion to FRNGE.  The changes are cosmetic only.  The logic
   that dictates which points in other singleband delay boxes make it onto the
   fringe rate plot also differs slightly from FRNGE.  The new algorithm is believed
   to be more accurate.

11. The horizontal axes of the plots on both pages are not yet labelled.

12. When less than 14 channels are present, fourfit leaves blank space on the lower
   page, below the segmented data plots.  FRNGE puts zeroes in this location.

13. Quality factors A, C and F are not supported yet (and may never be, depending
   on postprocessing strategy decisions to be taken).

14. At the bottom of the lower page, fourfit places the names of the control file
   used, and the full unix pathname of the output fringe file.  These replace the
   HP-1000 specific equivalent information found at slightly different locations
   on a FRNGE plot.

15. Fourfit does not separately list the manual phasecal values if used.  They can
   be found from the MODE value (item 8 above) and the channel PCALPH1 and 2
   numbers below the plot on the lower page.

16. When plotting the cross-power spectrum in the right-hand portion of the upper
   plot, fourfit overwrites any existing characters (i.e. unlike FRNGE, the entire
   cross-power spectrum is always visible).  Also, all phase points are plotted,
   regardless of the amplitude at that point.  By default, cross-power spectra are
   plotted when the scan SNR exceeds 100, rather than when the amplitude exceeds
   1 percent as in FRNGE.  Forced plotting of the spectrum is available through
   the -s option in fourfit.

17. OPT and SG in the extreme bottom right of the lower page are not filled in by
   fourfit (they are specific to FRNGE special modes).

18. The special 'B' error code expanded fringe-rate plot is not supported by 
   fourfit.

19. The STAT field just above the SNR on the upper page is not filled in by fourfit.
   There is a new field, "bc" just to the right of "me" on the right side of the
   lower page.  This is a count of the number of AP's discarded due to a small
   number of bits processed through the sine or cosine channels of the correlator,
   normally a consequence of very low fringe rates (it stands for "bad count").

20. For the most part, FRNGE and fourfit results agree numerically to high accuracy.
   Phases are normally within 0.1 degrees, and overall fringe amplitudes agree
   to typically 0.1 percent.  Algorithmic differences may produce larger discrepancies 
   in cases dominated by noise.
