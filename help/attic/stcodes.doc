COMMAND NAME:   stcodes

SYNOPSIS:  Inserts mk4_site_ID statements in observe VEX files

SYNTAX:  stcodes [-a] [-m msglev] [-o outfile] [-u] vexfile
		where all arguments except the vexfile are optional

OPTION FLAGS:	-a
			Switches on execution-time accounting

		-m msglev
			Verbosity control.  -3=verbose, +3=silent,
			default=1.

		-o outfile
			Specifies where to write the modified VEX file.
			By default the program writes to stdout.

		-u
			Causes the program to obtain Mk4 codes for all
			stations from the user, instead of using the
			default alias list.

ARGUMENTS:	vexfile
			The input VEX file, which must contain a $SITE
			section with 'site_name' and 'site_ID' values.

ENVIRONMENT:	MK4TXTDIR, which points to the location of the text files
		which support the VEX parser library, and the file which
		specifies the default aliases between international
		2-character station IDs, and 1-character Mk4 IDs.  The
		default is /correlator/text.


DESCRIPTION:

Because of substantial legacy code, both at the Mk4 correlators and in the
geodesy community, it is necessary to label stations with a single character
code.  Normally, observe VEX files will have the 8-char station name and a
2-char standard international ID.  This program inserts an additional VEX
statement in the $SITE def for each station, which specifies its Mk4 single
character ID.  This ID must be unique within the file.  In order to avoid
random and confusing redefinitions of stations from file to file, stcodes by
default looks up a standard mapping of 2-char to 1-char IDs, as described in
the external file mk4codes.txt.  Sometimes, multiple stations will have the 
same default Mk4 code, and sometimes unknown stations will be encountered.
In those cases, stcodes prompts the user to supply the Mk4 1-char code which
should be used.  When duplicate codes are found, the first one encountered is
kept, and all others are changed.  The default codes can be overridden by use of
the -u flag.

The stcodes program MUST be run on incoming observe VEX files before correlation
on a Mk4 correlator.
