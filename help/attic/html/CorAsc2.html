CorrAsc2 reads correlator data files from stdin and can 
debug print more-or-less everything therein.  Typical usage: 
<PRE WIDTH = 80> 
     CorAsc2  xxx  <  datafile  |  more 
</PRE> 
where xxx is the record type to be debug printed and datafile 
is the name of a correlator data file.  Replace xxx with any
record type from the list:  000, 100, 101, 120, 130, 131, 141, 
142, 143, 144, 150, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 
210, 212, 220, 221, 230, 300, 301, 302, 304, 306, 307, 308, or TDB. 
<P> 
The latest version can now print multiple file types 
with multiple xxx on the command line and now also counts and 
prints the number of records of each record type.
<P> 
CorAsc2 is a rough unsophisticated test program.
