<P>	<STRONG>Composer</STRONG> is a shell script that calls <STRONG>tgen</STRONG>, described below. 
Operation of <STRONG>composer</STRONG> is intended to be self-explanatory.  It
asks questions about the parameters needed to run <STRONG>tgen</STRONG> and puts
the answers on the command line to <STRONG>tgen</STRONG>.  Here is an example of a
typical <STRONG>composer</STRONG> dialog.  Answers typed by the user are
<U>underlined</U>: </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>This composer script runs tgen to read vex files and write a task </P>

<P>(tsf) file for opera to send to conductor.  For each question, </P>

<P>just Enter or Return to keep defaults. </P>

<P>Experiment code (in global.evex) is 2611_std, change to: <U>2600_std</U></P>

<P>Correlator mode key defaults from evex, change to:  </P>

<P>Number of useable tape drives is 6, change to:  </P>

<P>Station list is a string of one-letter station codes with no spaces.</P>

<P>Station list defaults to all in ovex, change to: <U>CXDBF</U></P>

<P>Following times are in the format ddd-hh:mm:ss. </P>

<P>Start time defaults to start of ovex, change to: <U>303-19:40:00</U></P>

<P>End time defaults to end of ovex, change to: <U>303-20:21:00</U></P>

<P>Use Lvex (Y or N) is Y, change to:  </P>

<P>The output file will be created or, if it exists, appended. </P>

<P>Output file (in directory $TASK) is mytask, change to: <U>2600_proc</U></P>

<P>  I changed that to 2600_proc.tsf </P>

<P>If this is all OK, just Enter or Return.  Or to fix (correct) </P>

<P>  any of your entries, type F; to abort, type ^C (Ctrl C): </P>

<P>Tgen will write to file $TASK/2600_proc.tsf = 

	/correlator/task/2600_proc.tsf </P>

<P>composer starting tgen, be patient ... </P>

<P>	<STRONG>Tgen</STRONG> is ready for alpha testing.  <STRONG>Tgen</STRONG>, normally called from
<STRONG>composer</STRONG>, reads ovex and lvex files and generates task files to
be sent to <STRONG>conductor</STRONG> for correlation.  <STRONG>Tgen</STRONG> has some known
inefficiencies (e.g., it's sometimes very slow, and it doesn't
always minimize tape changes) but no known obvious errors.  It
does not yet know how to do subnetting.  (Later versions will
read also reprocess lists (a-file format) to make reprocess task
files.  Meanwhile, see <STRONG>a2t</STRONG> for reprocessing.)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Please try <STRONG>tgen</STRONG> and tell us about errors or shortcomings. 
To run <STRONG>tgen</STRONG> without <STRONG>composer</STRONG>, try: </P>

<P>All the arguments are optional: <EM>experiment_file_name</EM> defaults to
2611_std; <EM>mode_key</EM>, the correlator mode, defaults to just a
comment in the task file, which tells conductor to read the
default from evex; <EM>number_of_active_SUs</EM> (number of usable tape
drives) defaults to 6, <EM>station_list</EM> (no spaces, order is
significant) defaults to all stations, <EM>start_time</EM> defaults to
zero, <EM>end_time</EM> defaults to end of the year, and <EM>use_lvex</EM> defaults
to Y (yes).  A dot (.) acts as a placeholder, if necessary, to
preserve the defaults for any previous arguments.  The
<EM>output_file_name</EM> should end in .tsf and be put into $TASK.</P>
