<P><FONT FACE="" SIZE="-1"><STRONG>Sara2lvex</STRONG> is a new program now available for beta testing. 
<STRONG>Sara2lvex</STRONG> reads VLBA log files in the format produced by the NRAO
program <STRONG>sara</STRONG> and writes Mark-4-compatible lvex files.  <STRONG>Sara2lvex</STRONG>
needs to read also the ovex file for the same experiment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="" SIZE="-1">The quality of the lvex output is dependent on the quality of
both the input files: You need to have a good ovex file before
running <STRONG>sara2lvex</STRONG>.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="" SIZE="-1"><STRONG>Sara</STRONG> is available on various NRAO machines such as
aspen.aoc.nrao.edu. On such machines, <STRONG>sara</STRONG> is available in /opt/local/vlbsoft/bin/sara with source code in /home/magnolia2/vlbsoft/obsprgms/solaris/sara.c (etc.) and documentation in
/home/magnolia2/vlbsoft/doc/sara.txt.  <STRONG>Sara</STRONG> reads VLBA binary
logs and writes an ASCII equivalent, which, depending on the
commands to <STRONG>sara</STRONG>, can contain all the information in the binary
logs.  <STRONG>Sara2lvex</STRONG> works well with the <STRONG>sara</STRONG> defaults, or, to save a
little disk space, ask for typecodes C1, COM, FLG, and TAP only.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="" SIZE="-1"><STRONG>Sara2lvex</STRONG> has some known problems especially with respect to the
notorious broken scans:  VLBA stations usually ignore the pass
numbers and tape directions in the schedule and put scans on the
tape wherever they fit.  This results in some scans being broken
into two pieces when the tape drive hits either of the low-tape
sensors.  <STRONG>Sara2lvex</STRONG> makes such broken scans into two partial
scans (with the same scan name) and adds a comment "Continuation
of previous scan" to the second part.  Search for these comments
with an editor.  Deleting or commenting out the less-desirable of
the partial scans is probably the best that can be done with the
Mark-4 correlator:  <STRONG>Genaroot</STRONG> will use the last of the two if it
is not deleted or commented.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="" SIZE="-1"><STRONG>Sara2lvex</STRONG> is based on a Perl script, <STRONG>vlvex.pl</STRONG>, written by Dave
Graham of MPIfR, Bonn, Germany and on a C program, <STRONG>vlogx</STRONG>, written
by Nancy Vandenburg of NVI, Inc. and NASA GSFC.  <STRONG>Vlogx</STRONG> is in
ftp://gemini.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/sked/vlogx/source/... with
documentation in .../pub/sked/vlogx/vlogx.txt.</FONT></P>
