<H2> ---- Logging ---- </H2> 
<P> 
     A separate program, Log, and a script, largo (alias llog), 
provide message logging.  From your window manager, get an xterm 
or hpterm to be used only for logging.  In this term, run the csh 
script largo.  This script first edits the message alias file, 
MesAlias, to append LOG@ to all active lines, which causes a 
copy to be sent to LOG of all messages that are sent to aliases
in this alias file.  Then largo starts the Log (LOG) program, 
which sends a one-line note to the screen and to the log file 
$TMP/mlog for each message that it receives.  Log also sends
a copy of the whole message (binary) to the binary log file 
$TMP/blog.  The last (hex) number on each line in the mlog 
file is the byte offset from the start of the blog file to the 
start of the corresponding binary message therein. 
<P> 
     Note that Log does not receive and cannot log any messages 
that are sent directly, that is without using an alias. 
<P> 
     To terminate logging, ^C (Ctrl-C) or whatever your term uses 
for interrupt in the log window.  The largo script then terminates 
Log and--this is important--restores the alias file.  Whenever you 
restart the largo script, any previous contents of mlog and blog 
are saved in mlog.bak and blog.bak, but only once.
