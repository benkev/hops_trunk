<P> 
The tapehead() function incorporated into suman provides a
tape-head-offset database for each pass on each tape.  This
augmentation of suman is now in beta testing at Haystack. 
<P> 
This database is in $TAPEINFO = /correlator/tapelib/tapeinfo, one
file per tape, labeled by its volume-serial number, VSN.  (This
directory must exist and be readable, writable, and executable by
group vlbi.)  When a tape is erased and checked out of the
library by tuba, the corresponding file gets a .01, .02, and so
forth suffix on its name.  A new empty file is created
automatically by suman when a tape returns with new data. 
<P> 
The format of these database files is defined in $INC/tapeDB.h. 
These files can be read and listed by CorAsc2, and a script,
tapit, simplifies this, 
<PRE> 
     tapit  VSN 
</PRE>
where <I>VSN</I> is the volume serial number of the tape and 
also the database file name as shown by 
<PRE> 
     ls  $TAPEINFO 
</PRE> 
Here is an example of a listing from tapit (CorAsc2):

The heading of this listing shows the station letter code, the
experiment number, the experiment name, and the starting year and
day of the recording.  This heading also shows the last five SUs
on which this tape was mounted and read--this to help disentangle
problems that might be due to either the station's or the SU's
tape drive.  This SU list is in time sequence left to right. 
<P> 
Each pass is labeled by an index number, by F or R for forward or
reverse, and by headpos, its nominal head offset (in microns)
from ovex or lvex.  The pass index numbers in this listing are
reference numbers and not the same as conventional pass numbers. 
These index numbers are in the order that the passes were
encountered in processing, not necessarily the order recorded. 
<P> 
The tape-head offsets are in microns for each 500 feet of tape
(13 numbers per line, 3 lines, 38 numbers for 19000 feet) in
order from beginning to end on the tape.  A -- entry means
initialized but not set. 
<P> 
This tape in this example, VLBA1153, has been up on four
different SUs, 0 4 5 2, in this order, most recently on SU 2. 
Not all the head-offset numbers in this listing are independent
because on starting each new pass, tapehead() in suman copies 
what it can from a nearby pass in the same direction and also
extrapolates to nearby footages to give hints to help peak the
tape heads.  Beginning with version_number 02, tapehead() still
calculates such hints but never writes them into the tape
database, so they do not appear in this listing. 
<P> 
A new program, edtap, to edit these database files is also
available for beta testing.  Try: 
<PRE> 
     edtap  VSN 
</PRE> 
Edtap begins by listing the contents of the selected database
file in the same format as CorAsc2 above.  Then edtap permits
changing all the numbers in a prescribed pass to a prescribed
constant in microns.  This is usually satisfactory at least to
find a pass since the offsets vary little through a pass.  Edtap
is intended to be self-explanatory.  Edtap can edit a file even
if suman is using it simultaneously.  Enter or Return to end
edtap.
