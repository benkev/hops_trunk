Documentation for the CCFIO (Correlator control file IO) library
----------------------------------------------------------------

Documentor:  CJL March 29 1995

This library consists mainly of support routines that should never
get called from application code.  The interface to the correlator
control files is handled through only two IO routines and an
initialization routine, described below.  You must include the
header file to use these routines, and you will have to refer
to the contents of the header file to make any sense of what the
routines do.  The header file is thoroughly documented (ahem -
real soon now!).

#include "ccfile.h"			Needed for all ccf operations

ccontrol_file *			File: $CCFIO/read_ccfile.c
read_ccfile (filename, 			Reads the specified sections
	which_sections, errflag)	of the ccf "filename" into a
char *filename;				dynamically allocated ccf
long which_sections;			memory structure, and returns
long *errflag;				a pointer to the structure.
					The sections are specified via
					bits in the "which_sections"
					mask.  Success or failure is
					indicated by corresponding bits
					in the errflag mask.  Structure
					and mask definitions are in
					$INC/ccfile.h

int				File: $CCFIO/write_ccfile.c
write_ccfile (filename, ccf)		Writes the contents of the "ccf"
char *filename;				memory structure to the disk
ccontrol_file *ccf;			file "filename" as a standard
					ccf file.
					Return: 0=good, else bad

void				File: $CCFIO/init_ccfile.c
init_ccfile (ccf)			Initializes the contents of
ccontrol_file *ccf;			the "ccf" memory structure.
