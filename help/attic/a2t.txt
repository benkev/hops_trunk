----- a2t ----- 

a2t is a rather crude utility program that reads a reprocess list
in afile fringesum format and writes a reprocess task-stream file
to stdout.  The lines in the input file should be grouped by
scan, preferably in time sequence.  Command-line arguments are
the afile name, an ordered station list, and the number of SUs.  
The output is normally redirected to a something.tsf file.  Since 
a2t knows the experiment number but not the experiment key, you 
may need to edit the output file to add ekey and also mode. 

Typical usage: 
     a2t  Afilename  Stationlist  NumSUs  >  outfile.tsf 
or use >> instead of > to append to an existing task-stream file. 

Since a2t can now be called from the composer script, this is the 
recommended usage.
