------------------------------------------------------------

COMMAND NAME:   atofits

SYNOPSIS:  Translates type-2 A-file records to FITS format

SYNTAX:  atofits [-m msglevel] [-o outfile] afilename ccfilename

OPTION FLAGS:	-m msglevel
			Verbosity control parameter, ranging from -3 to +3,
			with lower numbers being more verbose.  The default
			value is 1.
		-o outfile
			If specified, this flag directs the FITS output
			of atofits to the named file.  The default output
			goes to a file named "atofits.out".

ARGUMENTS:	afilename
			This is the input data file.  Only the type-2
			(fringe) records are processed.  Only one experiment,
			frequency code, and source is permitted per
			execution of the program.
		ccfilename
			This is the name of the correlator control file
			associated with the input data file.  It is used to
			get the information necessary to write the antenna
			table.  It is also needed for some of the header
			information (source coordinates, for example).

ENVIRONMENT:	None


DESCRIPTION:

The program "atofits" is just about the simplest possible FITS writer for HOPS
A-file data.  It implements the old-style AIPS random parameter uv-FITS format
(not the new interferometry format used for the VLBA).  Multi-source files
are not supported, since convenient filtering is available in HOPS, and
concatenation is available in AIPS.  The data records are written assuming
"calamp" has already be invoked to convert amplitudes into Jy.  The data
record weights are proportional to the square root of the SNR as determined
by HOPS.  The output file seems to be digestible by the AIPS program FITLD.
