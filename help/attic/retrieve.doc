----------------------------------------------------------

COMMAND NAME:   retrieve

SYNOPSIS:  Helps the user restore archives to disk

SYNTAX:  retrieve

OPTION FLAGS:	None

ARGUMENTS:	None

ENVIRONMENT:	CORDATA, SCRATCH1 ... SCRATCHn

DESCRIPTION:

This shell script takes the guesswork out of restoring the contents of
archive tapes to disk.  The user types "retrieve" at the terminal,
and is prompted to select a destination disk, confirm the tape
drive device name, and load the tape in the drive.  The script then
extracts the data, and makes sure the file permission masks are set
appropriately.  If the user is running with the "operator" user ID,
the script includes the operational data area as a possible destination,
and does not fiddle with the file permissions under the assumption
that the data are to remain protected from general users, just like
before the data were archived.

There are a couple of things to note about the script, and the archives
it accesses.  This script assumes that it is reading a tape written
by the "archive" shell script.  Because that script writes from inside
the experiment directory, the tar tape does not contain the experiment
directory itself.  Since this directory is required by much of the 
software, the "retrieve" script must recreate it.  Therefore, the user
is prompted for the experiment number at the start of the script.  It
is an error to omit this number.  If you want to place your experiment
in a semi-private subdirectory within the scratch areas, the recommended
action is to "retrieve" normally, then "mv" the resulting experiment
directory to the desired location.  This MUST be somewhere in that same
scratch area, otherwise you may accidentally end up physically moving
hundreds of megabytes of data around unnecessarily.  The "mv" command
should execute in well under 1 second.

Later versions of this script may try to get the experiment number
automatically.  Also, the method for generation of archive tapes may
be changed to include the experiment directory.

This script does not look at the contents of the tape.  It will just
dump the files into the experiment directory you specify.  Error checking
is minimal, and you must respond to questions accurately, or the
script may simply die on you.
