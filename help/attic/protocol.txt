GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS: 
  
Since the MCB standard interface is used, the electrical specifications  
and initiation protocol can be found in the appropriate MCB documents.  A block 
of 256 addresses are employed, of which only the lower 240 are available  
to the user (controller).  The origin of the block is set by a DIP switch on the
interface, and is unknown to the recorder controller.  Hence, all addresses 
specified here will be referenced relative to 0; of course, actual commands 
should have the fixed offset appropriate to the drive added in.  A further  
subdivision of the 240 byte address space has been made to separate the control 
(write) requests from the monitor (read) requests, as suggested by the MCB  
group.  Address 00-7F request monitor data (read-only), and addresses 80-EF are 
reserved for control requests.  The control request locations are actually  
read-write, since a read from one of these locations will echo back the last  
control request received at the same location.  In general, there is some
duplication of monitor data available, since commands which affect the state of 
the controller will be reported separately in the read (00-7F) section.  This 
is done so that we may present what actually IS (by reading back latched ports, 
etc. ), as opposed to what WAS commanded (returned in 80-EF). Only quantities
that can actually be sampled or measured by the hardware are duplicated.
  
  
NOTES:  

   1) Control requests having a single bit, such as REWIND TAPE, still  
      require that bit to be set for action to take place.  

   2) The ERROR FLAGS word is monitor word 74:  If any error bit is  
      set, so will be the ERROR EXISTS bit (0) of the General Status Word.  
      Reading the ERROR FLAGS word will clear all error bits, although  
      they can immediately be set again in the event of a persistent error.
