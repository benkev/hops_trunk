COMMAND NAME:   cdump

SYNOPSIS:  Peruses binary data files and displays them in ascii form

SYNTAX:  cdump [input file]

OPTION FLAGS:	None

ARGUMENTS:	input file
			This optional argument starts cdump with the
			specified file read in.  The "read" command
			inside this interactive program overwrites
			whatever data, if any, has already been read
			in.

ENVIRONMENT:	None

DESCRIPTION:

As essentially the first program to be written on the unix systems, cdump
does not conform as well to established conventions of coding or operation
as would be desired.  Nevertheless, it works reasonably well, and upgrading
it is therefore not a high priority.  Several commands are available
inside cdump, a list of which can be obtained by typing "?" at the prompt
at any time.

Commands currently supported are:

        mode    (hexadecimal, decimal) for certain data types
        skip nnn    (skips over nnn records, default 1)
        find 'type'    (positions at next record of specified type)
        bdump filename    (switches on binary dump of records to file)
        file filename    (directs output to file or printer)
        display nnn    (produces ascii summary of record(s))
        columns nnn    (number of columns to use for print)
        open filename    (opens a new data file)
        status    (shows current program settings)
        index    (sets corel index # filter, type 1 files only)
        summary nnn    (as display but one-line hex summary)
                        (type 1 files only)
        ! command    (shell escape)
        quit
