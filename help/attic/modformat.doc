COMMAND NAME:   modformat

SYNOPSIS:  A stdin/stdout filter for prettifying .mod files

SYNTAX:  cat progname.mod | modformat
		This is a filter which passes normal files unchanged,
		but beautifies the format of program modification
		(.mod) files.

OPTION FLAGS:	None

ARGUMENTS:	None

ENVIRONMENT:	None


DESCRIPTION:

This is a simple filter (normally fed via a Unix pipe) which permits
easier viewing of the contents of .mod files.  These .mod files are
generated by the "mod" script, and contain a history of modifications
to source code.  Any input lines which do not conform to the .mod
file format are passed unchanged by the filter.

Instead of always having to manually pipe files with this format into
modformat, it can be convenient to set up a couple of aliases for
commands that you might typically wish to use on .mod files, such
as grep, cat, and more.  In the setup.csh file for HOPS there are
commented-out examples called "modgrep", "modcat" and "modmore",
which are defined as follows:

alias modgrep 'grep \!* | modformat'
alias modcat 'cat \!* | modformat'
alias modmore 'cat \!* | modformat | more'

You can insert these in your personal .cshrc file as you see fit, or
ask your HOPS guru to uncomment them in the setup.csh file.  It may
not be advisable to use the same names "grep", "cat" and "more" for
these aliases, as the modformat filtering may confuse other scripts
that are expecting generic versions of these utilities.  Only the
first pass through modformat changes a file, so stringing together
these commands in pipe chains will work fine.
