COMMAND NAME:   linkdata

SYNOPSIS:  Creates a "mirror" data directory based on input A-file

SYNTAX:  linkdata [-r] [-d destdir] afile1 afile2 ... afilen
		where [] arguments are optional
		Note: all option flags must appear before afiles

OPTION FLAGS:	-r
			Specifies that parent root extents are NOT 
			to be sought separately from the input A-file 
			list (default behaviour is to make sure every 
			file has associated root)
		-d
			destdir specifies that 'destdir' is to be used 
			as the destination directory to receive the 
			linked files.  The default is the current working 
			directory ('.')

ARGUMENTS:	afile list
			A list of one or more A-files which describe the
			data to be mirrored.

ENVIRONMENT:	DATADIR

DESCRIPTION:

Program to convert a specification of a subset of data into a directory 
structure filled with symbolic links to the real data.  This "dummy" 
directory structure can then be used to perform any desired operation on 
the selected subset of data.  The subset specification takes the form of 
a standard A-file, presumably filtered according to various criteria by 
"aedit".  The overall result is a flexible tool for selecting and operating 
on data, be it generation of export tapes, refringing, or recorrelating 
operations, or applications not yet anticipated.
