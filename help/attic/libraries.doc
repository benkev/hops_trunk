Documentation of software libraries in HOPS
-------------------------------------------

Documentor:  CJL, 29 March 1995

Much of the software in HOPS is of a generic nature, and is
designed to be used by more than one program.  Almost without
exception, any routine which is used by two or more programs
has been placed in one of the several libraries.  This practise
minimises total code volume and the associated maintenance
burden.

As far as possible, the libraries have been designed to present
a simple and convenient interface to the application
programmer.  The general principle has been to do as much
low-level, application-independent work as possible behind
the scenes in the library.  The programmer is given tools
to manipulate the behaviour of the library, in the form of
a small number of parameters passed to the library functions.
These parameters, and the calling sequences for the library
routines, are intended to be very stable, thus facilitating
the development of robust, stable application code.

Libraries are hard to use unless their interfaces are
adequately documented.  To access the HOPS library documentation
files, type "vhelp lib????", where "????" is the name of the
library you are interested in.  Below is a list and brief
description of all current HOPS libraries.

Library Name		Function
------------            --------
afio			A-file IO library
			Handles a variety of operations
			concerning the A-file format.
			All A-file IO should go through
			this library.

bfio			Binary file IO library
			Handles all IO to and from binary
			correlator and associated files.
			
ccfio			Correlator control file IO library
			Handles reading and writing of
			correlator control files.

x_fplot			X-window fringe-plot popup library
			Displays fringe plots on X-displays.

util			HOPS utility library
			A diverse collection of commonly
			used routines.  This library should
			be used to promote a standard
			"look and feel" among HOPS programs.

The source code for these libraries can be found in $????,
where "????" is the library name converted to upper case.
