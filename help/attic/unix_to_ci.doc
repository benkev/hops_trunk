COMMAND NAME:   unix_to_ci

SYNOPSIS:  Converts unix data files to CI naming convention

SYNTAX:    unix_to_ci [-d output directory] [data file list]
		Where all arguments except the data file list are optional.
		Note: all option flags must appear before the data file list

OPTION FLAGS:	-d output directory
			If present, this overrides the default destination
			for the CI-named files.  The default is
			$CORDATA/transfer.

ARGUMENTS:	data file list
			A list of files to rename to CI conventions
			(useless without roots).  unix_to_ci follows the
			standard MkIV data file specification format.
			You may specify individual filenames,
			scan directories which contain data files,
			experiment directories, or any combination of
			these three.  In the latter two cases, unix_to_ci
			will descend the directory tree looking for
			data files to add to its internal list of files to
			process.  Beware of trying to specify too many
			files or scan directories, as it is possible to
			overflow the Unix argument list buffer on large
			experiments.  In such cases, specify the experiment
			directory instead.

ENVIRONMENT:	CORDATA

DESCRIPTION:

This program is provided for those circumstances (hopefully rare) when it
is desired to ship data back to the HP-1000 systems from the unix systems.
The program does not attempt to recreate the original CI filenames, but
instead merely makes sure the names are unique in each execution of the
program.  The sophistication of the program in this regard is commensurate
with its anticipated frequency of use.  The user is expected to take
responsibility for ensuring its meaningful application.

Unix_to_ci does not make physical copies of the files in the destination
directory, but instead makes symbolic links to the files which remain in
the unix data directories.  Removing the symbolic links with the rm
command will not harm the unix data files.  The program is fast on account
of this symbolic link implementation.
