Principal differences between FRNGE plots and fourfit plots (CJL 4/11/94)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Frequencies are labelled with alphabetic characters instead of numbers.
   This scheme follows through to the channel-by-channel plots and
   information on the lower half of the page.  These frequency identifiers
   are tied to the LO frequencies, and are used to identify the sideband
   pairs in the fourfit control file (keywords "freqs", "pcal_phases", etc.).
   They are ordered the same way as the LO frequencies in the type 2400
   record of the root.

2. The L, A, U indicators for lower, dual and upper sideband data in the 
   segmented amplitude plots on the lower page are replaced by -, * and +.
   This avoids possible confusion with the alphabetic phase indicators, with
   better visual separation of amplitude and phase.

3. The T character in the all-channel segmented amplitude plot on the lower
   page is replaced by 'A', to denote amplitude.  The 'P' remains, to denote
   phase.

4. The phasecal phase plots on the lower page are keyed by the frequency code
   letter.  Upper case means reference station, lower case means remote
   station.

5. The FMGR file name on the 5th line of top and bottom pages is replaced by
   the unix root extension code.

6. The start and stop times are calculated slightly differently.  There is no
   important consequence of this change, but see item 9 below.

7. Counts of CRC errors, time discards, slip syncs and so on are slightly 
   different, due to the order in which operations are done in fourfit versus
   FRNGE.  None of these differences are thought to be of any consequence.
   In fourfit, some of the records are discarded early, before errors other
   than bad time tags can be detected.

8. The MODE quantity (next to SNR on the upper page) has a completely
   different meaning to the FRNGE number.  The pc mode indicators are a
   single character for the reference station, followed by one for the
   remote station. The possible characters are N (normal), A (ap_by_ap
   mode), and M (manual).

9. On the segmented plots on the lower page, the time span of the data is
   defined to be the interval between the first and last APs with
   valid time tags.  This definition differs slightly from FRNGE, so
   that the segmenting is somewhat different.  In particular, fourfit
   will tend to have more segments with no gap at the beginning or end,
   compared to FRNGE, on a dataset that starts producing good data late
   (or stops early).

10. The fringe rate spectrum on the upper plot is gridded onto the page in a
    slightly different fashion to FRNGE.  The changes are cosmetic only.
    The logic that dictates which points in other singleband delay boxes
    make it onto the fringe rate plot also differs slightly from FRNGE.
    The new algorithm is believed to be more accurate.

11. The horizontal axes of the plots on both pages are not yet labelled.

12. When less than 14 channels are present, fourfit leaves blank space on the
    lower page, below the segmented data plots.  FRNGE puts zeroes in this
    location.

13. Quality factors A, C and F are not supported yet (and may never be,
    depending on postprocessing strategy decisions to be taken).

14. At the bottom of the lower page, fourfit places the names of the control
    file used, and the full unix pathname of the output fringe file.
    These replace the HP-1000 specific equivalent information found at
    slightly different locations on a FRNGE plot.

15. Fourfit does not separately list the manual phasecal values if used.
    They can be found from the MODE value (item 8 above) and the channel
    PCALPH1 and 2 numbers below the plot on the lower page.

16. When plotting the cross-power spectrum in the right-hand portion of the
    upper plot, fourfit overwrites any existing characters (i.e. unlike
    FRNGE, the entire cross-power spectrum is always visible).  Also, all
    phase points are plotted, regardless of the amplitude at that point.
    By default, cross-power spectra are plotted when the scan SNR exceeds
    100, rather than when the amplitude exceeds 1 percent as in FRNGE.
    Forced plotting of the spectrum is available through the -s option
    in fourfit.

17. OPT and SG in the extreme bottom right of the lower page are not filled
    in by fourfit (they are specific to FRNGE special modes).

18. The special 'B' error code expanded fringe-rate plot is not supported by 
    fourfit.

19. The STAT field just above the SNR on the upper page is not filled in
    by fourfit.  There is a new field, "bc" just to the right of "me"
    on the right side of the lower page.  This is a count of the number
    of AP's discarded due to a small number of bits processed through the
    sine or cosine channels of the correlator, normally a consequence of
    very low fringe rates (it stands for "bad count").

20. For the most part, FRNGE and fourfit results agree numerically to high
    accuracy.  Phases are normally within 0.1 degrees, and overall fringe
    amplitudes agree to typically 0.1 percent.  Algorithmic differences
    may produce larger discrepancies in cases dominated by noise.
