Documentation for the program "linkdata"
----------------------------------------

COMMAND NAME:   linkdata

synopsis:  Creates a "mirror" data directory based on input A-file

SYNTAX:  linkdata [-r] [-s] [-d destdir] afile1 afile2 ... afilen
        where [] arguments are optional
        Note: all option flags must appear before afiles

OPTION FLAGS:   -r
                    Specifies that parent root extents are NOT 
                    to be sought separately from the input A-file 
                    list (default behaviour is to make sure every 
                    file has associated root)
                -s
                    Specifies that station (type-3) files are NOT
                    to be sought separately from the input A-file
                    list (default behaviour is to include all 
                    associated station files)
                -d
                    destdir specifies that 'destdir' is to be used 
                    as the destination directory to receive the 
                    linked files.  The default is the current working 
                    directory ('.')

ARGUMENTS:  afile list
            A list of one or more A-files which describe the
            data to be mirrored.

ENVIRONMENT:    DATADIR

DESCRIPTION:

Program to convert a specification of a subset of data into a directory 
structure filled with symbolic links to the real data.  This "dummy" 
directory structure can then be used to perform any desired operation on 
the selected subset of data.  The subset specification takes the form of 
a standard A-file, presumably filtered according to various criteria by 
"aedit".  The overall result is a flexible tool for selecting and operating 
on data, be it generation of export tapes, refringing, or recorrelating 
operations, or applications not yet anticipated.

Note - for Mk4, only type-2 A-file lines are supported.  Other files,
namely root files and type-3 (station) files are, by default,
automatically identified and included in the link directory to facilitate
further processing.  Suppression of root and station file linkages can be
achieved via the -r and -s flags.
