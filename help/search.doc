Documentation for the program "search"
--------------------------------------

COMMAND NAME:   search

SYNOPSIS:  Searches incoherently averaged A-file data for fringes

SYNTAX:  search [-d device] [-g CxR:A] [-m msglevel] [-o outfile] [-x] filelist

OPTION FLAGS:	-d device
			Specifies the output graphics device for the
			contour plots of SNR in the delay/rate grid.
			The specification is in the standard PGPLOT form
			of filename/devicetype (e.g. test.ps/ps)

		-g CxR:A
			The default is 2 Columns and 2 Rows of plots per
			page, but you can use this option to suit your
			taste; with 1x1 you get one plot per page.  By
			default, the aspect ratio is chosen to reflect
			the relative number of sample points in the two
			directions (A == 0).  You can override this for
			a square plot (A == 1).

		-m msglevel
			Verbosity control parameter, ranging from -3 to +3,
			with lower numbers being more verbose.  The default
			value is 1.

		-o outfile
			If specified, this flag directs the A-file output
			of search to the named file.  If omitted, search
			writes its output to stdout.

		-x
			Shorthand for "-d /xw", the xwindow display.

ARGUMENTS:	filelist
			One or more input A-files which contain data generated
			by "average".  These data have been segmented and
			incoherently averaged at each point on a grid of rate
			and delay.  Such a grid is set up using fringex.
			

ENVIRONMENT:	HOPS_SEARCH_REMLIMIT, HOPS_SEARCH_OLDWAY, HOPS_SEARCH_INCR


DESCRIPTION:

Search finds the peak of averaged A-file data (presumably generated by
the fringex and average tools).  For each baseline, a plot and output
A-file line is usually generated.

The HOPS_SEARCH_REMLIMIT is available to relax a constraint on the placement
of SNR values in the plotting grid--you probably should not use this.  (The
default is equivalent to supplying this with a value of 0.1.)

If set, the HOPS_SEARCH_OLDWAY activates some older code, and if set,
HOPS_SEARCH_INCR makes the newer code behave as the older code does.
