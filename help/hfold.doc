------------------------------------

COMMAND NAME:   hfold

SYNOPSIS:  Assigns closure-consistent baseline phases

SYNTAX:  	hfold ampfile clsphfile <window>
          
OPTION FLAGS:	None.

ARGUMENTS:	ampfile
			A-list of all 'type 2' baseline summary lines which,
			at this point, should have best estimates of amplitude
			but random phases.  This file must be time ordered -
			early dates first (this requirement will be relaxed
			in later versions.

		clsphfile
			A-list of all 'type 3' triangle summary lines which
			correspond to the baseline entries in ampfile.  Or,
			the user can specify 'none' here which will still
			output all a-file lines in caltech format, but with
			interferometric phase as found in the input data
			(instead of finding a least squares fit).

		<window>
			Specifies the number of seconds to be interpreted as
			a time gap between scans.  Default is 190 seconds.
			This limits the use of Fold to scan averages but
			will be modified to handle more delicately parsed
			data in later versions.

ENVIRONMENT:	None.


DESCRIPTION:	Typically, the visibility amplitudes and phases are calculated
		at different times when reducing mm-VLBI data.  This comes
		about since the most sensitive fringe searches neglect phase
		entirely and use incoherent averages.  Closure phase gets
		calculated in a later step by averaging the bispectrum
		(triple product of complex visibility) and taking its
		argument.  In cm-wavelength VLBI where the closure phase
		is not averaged, one needs only to calculate the closure
		phase around independent station triangles.  Recall that a
		station triangle can be formed with a linear combination of
		three others.  When the bispectrum is averaged this linear
		property is lost and ALL triangles must be kept.

		Some imaging software packages, most notably the Caltech
		package, calculate the closure phase from baseline based phase.
		For this reason, a program (Fold) is needed to take the
		closure phase data for ALL triangles and find the optimum
		decomposition into baseline based phase.  Fold does this
		using a least squares routine that preserves as best it can,
		the original closure phase.  Since it is a global routine,
		there will nearly always be some discrepancies.  If the name
		of the closure phase file is 'none' then hfold acts only as
		a translator from afile format to caltech format preserving
		the phases as found by fringex, fourfit, fringe, etc...

		Note that Fold is still in development and does not have all
		the features one might want.  Currently, it is only able to
		output a format acceptable to the Caltech package.  Also it
		may fail if it finds foreign characters in the input file.
		One should sanitize the input files by making sure that only
		the A-summary lines are present - this means no headers from
		Aedit, or 'end of scan' markers from average.  Order is
		important for hfold input : both amplitude and bispectrum
		files must be in time order with the closure phase time
		range being a subset of the amplitude time range (i.e. no
		closure phases at times before amplitude data).
