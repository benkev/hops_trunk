COMMAND NAME:   calamp

SYNOPSIS:  Applies calibration data to A-file amplitudes

SYNTAX:  calamp [-c caltime] [-m msglev] [-o outfile] [-s] afilename calfilename
		-c allows control over required proximity of cal time
		-m controls verbosity
		-o overrides stdout default for output A-file
		-s forces program to use cal only on same source
		-t forces program to ignore Tant information
		afilename is the uncalibrated A-file input
		calfilename is file containing all cal info

OPTION FLAGS:	-c caltime
			For each VLBI scan, calamp will accept cals within
			caltime seconds of the start and end of the scan
			(more precisely, any cal after start-caltime and
			before end+caltime), and will simply average the
			cal values it finds.  The default is 600 seconds.
		-m msglev
			Verbosity control parameter, ranging from -3 to +3,
                        with lower numbers being more verbose.  The default
                        value is 1.
		-o outfile
			If specified, this flag directs the A-file output
                        of calamp to the named file.  If omitted, calamp
                        writes its output to stdout.
		-s
			Normally, calamp uses all cal scans within the allowed
			time range, issuing only a warning at message level 1
			when the cal source does not match the VLBI source 
			(message level -1 gives more details).  This flag turns
			the non-matching source condition into a non-valid
			cal, which then gets completely ignored (with no
			messages).
		-t
			Normally, when a 6-token line is encountered in the
			cal file, calamp performs a Ta/source flux calculation.  
			This flag suppresses this behaviour, and forces a
			Tsys/gain curve calculation.

ARGUMENTS:	afilename
			This is normally the final output of the fringe
			searching software, with amplitudes in units of
			10**-4 correlation coefficient calfilename This
			is a file containing calibration information
			feels like for all stations.  It is normally the
			output of the RCal program, written by John Ball,
			modified by hand editing in most cases.

ENVIRONMENT:	None.
