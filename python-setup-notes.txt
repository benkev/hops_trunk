Regarding the impending python 3.12 aggravating removal of distutils, I think the path forward is relatively straightforward, we just need to replace calls to "python setup.py" wit "pip install". In the cmake build this is handled with:

    if("${PYTHON_SETUP}" STREQUAL "setuptools")
        #use pip/setuptools
        install(CODE "execute_process(COMMAND ${PY_EXE} -m pip install ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} --upgrade --target=${PYTHON_MODULE_INSTALL_DIR} )")
    else()
        #use distutils
        install(CODE "execute_process( COMMAND ${PY_EXE} ${SETUP_PY} install --prefix=${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} )")
    endif()

for automake I think we just need to change the command executed by the install-exec-local target:

install-exec-local:
        ($(PYTHON) setup.py install \
                --prefix $(DESTDIR)$(prefix) \
                --record $(DESTDIR)$(pythondir)/$(PKG_NAME)/install_mk4_files.txt \
                --verbose)

to call the pip based equivalent. However we'll need to detect if their system has pip installed at configure time, since it does not come by default on many linux distros and isn't part of the standard library.

I liked it better when Guido was in charge... 


Ok...actually I lied. I forgot there are a couple other things which
need to change. One is the setup.py files themselves need to be processed
during configure so that:

from @PYTHON_SETUP@ import setup

(which replaces the standard import statement) becomes either:

from setuptools import setup

or:

from distutils.core import setup

depending on the local python version and whether or not setuptools/pip
is available.

The second thing is that pip pollutes the source directory with a bunch
of egg.info crap.

Try what I could with all the various flags passed to pip, the only way
I found around that was to just copy the whole source directory into the
build directory where the pollution doesn't matter and then install it
from there. Alternatively, we could clean it up after, but that plays
havoc with the dist/distcheck targets.
